    content: `<p><em>Virtual attendees standing by </em><strong><em>The Book of Distance</em></strong><em> exhibit in the MOR. The experience was written and directed by Randall Okita.<br></em><br><br>In June of pandemically-skewed 2020, I decided to go deep diving into the Cannes XR Virtual showcase; a collaborative Event from five key partners: Marché du Film, the Museum of Other Realities [MOR], Tribeca, Kaleidoscope, and Veer VR. While I had grand plans to review the entire curated exhibition of immersive entertainment hosted in the MOR, time did its usual thing and I found myself running out of it, with the Exhibition space accessible only for the three days of the event [June 24th to June 26th].<br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1222px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1222px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/foyer.jpg" loading="lazy"></div></figure><h3><strong>First Impressions Count<br>‍</strong></h3><p>On first entering the MOR foyer, one could see that the effort required to create such a space [and recode the existing VR Museum] was evidently made. The "follow-the-yellow-brick-road" approach to navigation [or in this case, “teleport-across-the-red-carpet”] could successfully build anticipation for the content to come. On entering the nexus of the Event wings, the realisation hit how each individual arcade/wing was built on an Escher-like construction plan. For instance, on approaching the end of the Tribeca Virtual Arcade the option to teleport directly onto the wall presented itself. On teleporting sideways onto the wall, a Penrose Stairs-like teleportation trek could be initiated to enter the other gallery wings, with the floor becoming the ceiling and vice-versa. The result was pleasingly mind-bending - to say the very least.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2157px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2157px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/escher_like_exhibition.jpg" loading="lazy"></div></figure><h3><strong>My Experience of the Showcase<br>‍</strong><br></h3><p>During my deep dive into the Event, I wanted to experience as many of the Cannes XR Virtual experiences as possible. The majority of the immersive works that I did experience happened to be from the Tribeca Virtual Arcade. What follows is a summation of some of the works on offer in the Tribeca wing and some others:&nbsp;</p><p>• <em>The Line: A Linha </em>[aka <em>The Line</em>] was an absolute wonder, a gorgeously realised and poignant clockwork-puppet love story traversing the stitching of emotional connection, the perils and joy of change, and the power of taking a path less travelled. In short, this work is highly recommended. It’s also been announced since the Cannes XR Virtual show that <em>The Line: A Linha </em>is now a 2020 Emmy Finalist in the 'Outstanding Innovation in Interactive Media' category.&nbsp;</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2040px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2040px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/the_line.jpg" loading="lazy"></div><figcaption><em>The Line</em></figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>• <em>The Book of Distance: </em>a gut-wrenching retelling of the terrible realities of the Canadian Japanese internment camps as told by the point of view of Randall Okita [as in a physically embodied VR “sketch” version of him at least] concerning his interred Grandfather. This stunning VR Experience is much more than just a simple retelling however, with archival documents and historical footage realized in a brilliant combination of 2D and 3D to flesh out the life story of an adventurous 15-year old Japanese Yoneso, who in 1935 leaves his Hiroshima home to journey to Canada, where his life unfurls into tragedy, loss, survival, and family-building. The interactive elements encountered operate as sublime narrative anchors, so much so that when interacting with certain letters and photographs I found myself bawling in my Vive headset [which was a challenge in itself to negotiate]. Put plainly: find a way to experience this beautiful, heartbreaking work.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2075px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2075px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/the_book_of_distance_2.jpg" loading="lazy"></div><figcaption><em>The Book of Distance</em></figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>• <em>Virtual Becomes Reality - A Stanford VR Experience</em>: An informative [if somewhat dry] VR tour through what the Stanford team has been researching in the field of VR, including their vision of how VR can change society for the better. Unfortunately, this tour illustrates just what powerful storytelling can do as opposed to a straight factual approach: the straightforward information and fact-based interactions in <em>A Stanford VR Experience </em>came across as stilted and clunky after experiencing the wonderfully story centric <em>The Book of Distance</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>• <em>Gravity</em>: An odd tale of two brothers falling through space in an exploded world. The room in which it was exhibited in the MOR was beautifully stark in its bare toned simplicity, and this minimalistic slant was reflected in the actual experience itself to great effect. It was a shame, then, that the interaction mechanics used in <em>Gravity VR </em>felt more like an afterthought, with the potential of the plot promising more than the actual realisation of it [even with the choose-your-own-adventure-ish ending fork and gorgeous visuals/spatials].</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:800px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="800px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/mor-gravity-clip.gif" loading="lazy"></div><figcaption>Gravity VR</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>• <em>Icarus</em>: A lovely VR work-in-progress that reworks the Greek Icarus myth into a quasi-operatic, demoscene-like spatial medley. I thought at first that this must have been the same team that crafted one of my favourite XR works [a VR music video called <em>Surge</em>] with <em>Surge </em>overtones percolating throughout in both the [initial] musical style and visual aspects. Turns out I was wrong though, as the team behind <em>Icarus </em>is<em> </em>actually a co-production between Lemieux Pilon 4D Art and Normal Studio.&nbsp;</p><p>• <em>Mary and the Monster</em>: A boisterous reimagining of the Frankenstein story [and its origins] with the emphasis centred firmly on Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley - as both an author and an embodiment of a [not so] monstrous other. A rollicking good meta-take on a familiar melodramatic tale, with a well-earned hat tip to both traditional stage production and the dollop of black comedy tinged with feminist-accented historicization [I loved it!]. </p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2430px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2430px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/mary_and_the_monster_.png" loading="lazy"></div><figcaption><em>Mary and the Monster</em></figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>• <em>Minimum Mass</em>: On entering the area housing this work [which was one I was most anticipating due to its tendril-creeping beyond its allocated exhibition room] I was confronted with a message stating that the experience wasn’t available due to tech difficulties. So, like any good curious [and stubborn] XR-boffin I went for a file-dive and [on having found the relevant .exe file] did a manual playthrough instead. Even though I’m sure I didn’t get to experience the work in its entirety, what I did find were intriguingly novel interaction mechanics supporting a haunting narrative centred around miscarriage, emotional ties, and the unavoidable weight/consequences of grief.&nbsp;</p><p>• <em>Alexa, Call Mom!</em>: A strange exhibit that was the first work that didn’t require activation by touching an MOR entry portal. The work bills itself as an: <em>“</em>...interactive IoT installation about grief and love where one user explores Alexa’s channeling powers as a spiritual medium. Due to social distancing guidelines, we are presenting this virtual teaser in lieu of the physical installation.” I wasn’t sure if the work itself didn’t activate correctly or if there was a problem with the MOR setup, but I couldn’t get past the introduction with it unfortunately replaying again and again with no progression past that point.</p><p>• <em>In Event of Moon Disaster</em>: An ingenious story-riff on the Apollo 11 moon landing, and what could have happened if the mission hadn’t gone as per plan. With a liberal dose of ‘beware what you watch’ warnings thrown in and a mixture of [possibly] ARG-inspired real and faked footage [created in part with the use of Deepfake tech] the story is a clever mockumentary, told from a 50’s-ish squat brown TV, with a speech that Nixon <em>would </em>have delivered if things had gone awry with the landing.&nbsp;</p><p>• <em>Fly</em>: An evocative educational take on the history of human flight from Leonardo da Vinci’s attempts to a futuristic “Speedbird” hypersonic jet. Although the pacing here seemed a tad speedy for the impact of the lovely interactive moments to sink in, there were moments that were incredibly evocative. From taking the controls of the Wright brothers first plane to guiding a 1969 Concorde, the immersive snippets encountered in <em>Fly </em>were a distinct highlight.&nbsp;</p><p>• <em>Violence: </em>This controversial Cannes XR Experience may have deliberately been designed to invoke associations to do with helplessness and powerlessness in the audience in order to fully empathise with the fictional VR character, and to acknowledge the overall social realities of the BLM movement. On my first playthrough the sensation of being unable to discern the locomotion mechanics [to help the VR character break the panels] was jaw- clenchingly frustrating, though that could be the exact point? Also, on a second playthrough [after researching the mechanics] the limitations of the virtual chaperone boundaries only allowed me to partially break a small number of the panels, before [I ironically] punched the wall of my actual physical studio. <em>Violence </em>also left me wanting to know more about the research methodology behind the study associated with this incredibly visceral and reverberating work [as well as needing to check my privilege on so many levels].</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2652px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2652px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/violence_screengrab1.png" loading="lazy"></div><figcaption><em>Violence</em></figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>• <em>Blood and Chocolate - A Variation on Queerskins Ark: </em>Being familiar with Queerskins and its heart-rending story, I was massively keen to see this second chapter. <em>Queerskins: Ark</em> manifests in 360 video form and I immediately gelled with the exhibition room - with all its familiar text-threading [a technique used extensively in our <a href="https://mezbreeze.itch.io/all-the-delicate-duplicates"><em>All the Delicate Duplicates</em></a>]. Filled with encompassing audio, volumetric spatials and elegant balletic, this work is an intimate animation of a velcroed-in-love dancing couple. I’d say that the 360-video variation of <em>Queerskins: Ark </em>doesn’t disappoint.&nbsp;</p><p>• <em>The Great C: </em>For a work that’s a few years old, it’s a cinematic VR feature, astoundingly striking as an experience - one that presents as an accomplished spatial film. Surprisingly, the lack of interactivity in <em>The Great C </em>actually adds to build immersion due to its subtle and innovative crafting, while the risk it takes with locomotion/user shifting, scale transitions and spatial ellipsis thoroughly work in favour of the experience. It's a sublime breakthrough experience and<em> </em>earned itself the Cannes XR Positron Visionary Award.&nbsp;</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1024px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1024px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/kmdyobci5znppobjqifbfmeutkhuprfjrosxheyxjbop_prn7syrlitl2c5flehukhyqrw6doseqiy_gfauytotuvbfizexqoob8msj8t_tenn9a4b82qeybogkpvpvklh37kihg.jpeg"></div></figure><p><br></p>`

Her VR tale begins sometime in 2018, a little after she saw a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TckqNdrdbgk">Tilt Brush commercial</a>&nbsp;which led her to start exploring painting in a new medium.&nbsp;<br></p><p>As a determined, self-taught VR artist, she quickly realized that there were questions to answer about&nbsp;Tilt Brush&nbsp;as a VR creation app. She has created a self-brand over the past two years by inviting her audience to constantly provide feedback. This is also what she advises her ardent community of followers to make efforts toward.<br>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="padding-bottom:56.206088992974244%" data-rt-type="video" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="" data-rt-max-height="56.206088992974244%" data-rt-dimensions="854:480" data-page-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZPO53YKA84"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-ZPO53YKA84"></iframe></div></figure><p>‍</p><p>One of Sabby’s more notable pieces<em>&nbsp;</em>is an immersive painting titled&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesabbylife.com/?pgid=jra5uhh8-33bce37e-a89e-4009-92cb-84ed6f81a05d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Da Vinci Paints the Mona Lisa</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>(created in<em>&nbsp;</em>Tilt Brush)<em>,&nbsp;</em>an artistic tribute to her favourite artist,<em>&nbsp;</em>Leonardo Da Vinci.<em>&nbsp;</em>The piece took her over 3 months to perfect. What is interesting is how much this early work paves her ideology - with VR performances and tutorial-making being a significant part of her art practice, collectively allowing her to be seen as an artist and as an active maker as she negotiates her mark-making. In her June 2020 interview with&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shkpZdpJSLY">Thom Clancy</a>, Sabby (as her avatar,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/TheSabbyLife/status/1277328321508814848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1277328321508814848%7Ctwgr%5E&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublish.twitter.com%2F%3Fquery%3Dhttps3A2F2Ftwitter.com2FTheSabbyLife2Fstatus2F1277328321508814848widget%3DTweet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">‘Popcorn’</a>) shared how much being seen matters in an internet-savvy art scene. Early in any public-facing journey, it’s hard to know what having followers could do for your craft. In Sabby’s case<em>,&nbsp;</em>an audience has not simply been garnered for engagement but also for curbing curiousity.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Early VR Experiments&nbsp;</strong><br></h3><blockquote><em>“I am quite an explorer — very inquisitive, usually able to figure things out on my own... When I first tried using Tilt Brush I realized that I could use my traditional digital 3D art skills to work this medium. It’s such a new medium that everything felt like a discovery. So I figured that I would have to start experimenting”.</em><br></blockquote><p>Sabby’s first VR experience was with&nbsp;Google Cardboard,&nbsp;after which she went on to try&nbsp;Samsung’s Gear VR. This became the headset which helped her assess the degrees of freedom she was wishful for. Her HTC Vive has been a loyal headset to her for a while now, with its 6DoF being a big factor.&nbsp;</p><p>In her workflow, she utilizes a wide array of VR software - starting with<em>&nbsp;</em>Tilt Brush, Gravity Sketch, AnimVR, Masterpiece VR, Neos VR, Logics and finally Mindshow. The combination of these software are also significant in pushing her virtual persona forward.&nbsp;<br></p><p>After she had ‘measured’ her workspace (plus scope) in&nbsp;Tilt Brush and experimented a bit with the brushes etc. - she felt all set to start sharing her work on her YouTube channel. &nbsp;So, while her performativity - in one sense - began with demystifying technicalities about<em>&nbsp;</em>Tilt Brush, it was soon channeled into live VR performances. Her YouTube videos have received 50,000+ views to date (she doubled her viewers and followers between when we interviewed her early in 2020 and today)! As the process of understanding the medium was heavily reliant on hits and misses she began to apply anatomy and colour-theory from prior knowledge, to improve her spatial skills in the new medium.&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote><em>“I would start with an idea, or even just a feeling. I’d try to imagine what I want to create. Sometimes I’d sketch it out and other times I just jump right in and start creating it in Gravity Sketch or Tilt Brush. From there, as I’d be making my scene or my art piece, I’d think about if it is going to be a process recording or some sort of experience. Would it be a 3D piece, 2.5D piece, or a 2D piece? Or even what its purpose could be - were not necessarily always decisions at the very outset, for me.”</em></blockquote><p><br></p><h3><strong>#365DaysofTiltBrush<br>‍</strong><br></h3><p>Tilt Brush<em>&nbsp;</em>has been key to Sabby's workflow - and this is a known fact among her followers thanks to her&nbsp;'365 days of Tilt Brush'<em>&nbsp;</em>project. When we asked her how this 365-Days-long project began, she told us how very early in her experience and understanding of VR she decided that her investment is towards a mastery of the medium. And so with every (deliberate) experiment, she was taking on challenges and learning the depth of each tool. By using all the brushes available, she could plan how she wanted to push her own boundaries. And with weekly themes to rely on, she had something new to create every single day of that week.<br></p><p>While there were instances when she just didn’t feel like putting on a headset and making art, she pushed herself and managed to make it through. There were even moments when her followers challenged her, freely suggesting that she try new themes. <br><br>A pro-tip she gave us about&nbsp;Tilt Brush&nbsp;is to “Unlock the scale! This lets you move around more easily, in a large environment.&nbsp;It’s just a command line in the config file - pretty easy to set up. Also, the ‘Disco Mode’ with the lighting is another hidden easter-egg in Tilt Brush that I recommend for people to try out.”<br>‍<br>‍<br></p><h3><strong>Lignes de Fleurs&nbsp;in the MOR<br>‍</strong><br></h3><p><em>Lignes de Fleurs</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/artists/sabby-lighf">her piece featured in the MoR</a>&nbsp;came from a themed week called&nbsp;'Line Work'. With a clear interest in the fine detail of flowers, the 2019 work reflects how Sabby<em>&nbsp;</em>has a keen understanding of botany, one that she wanted to broaden.&nbsp;“I just remembered a lot of details from biology class which I would notice in plants - I would notice things such as the iridescence on a flower petal. So I referenced that in the artwork”.<br></p><p>Sabby<em>&nbsp;</em>showed us her piece at the MoR and shared how the light shining on the coral pieces is her favourite little detail - a neat&nbsp;Tilt Brush&nbsp;brush trick helped her create this interesting illusion of light. The work has been quite well received, Sabby<em>&nbsp;</em>tells us, as she's been able to bring a wide number of people - across several events - to come and experience it in the museum.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:600px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="600px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/sabbyspatial.gif" loading="lazy"></div><figcaption>A spatial interview with Sabby Lighf (left) near her work, <strong><em>Lignes de Fleurs</em></strong> (2019) in the MOR</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>To maintain an active role in the VR community - Sabby sets aside a part of her workday to answer questions and respond to DMs. A lot of these questions are how-did-you-do-that queries -&nbsp;“How did you get that effect? How did you use this brush?”&nbsp;- generally coming her way in reaction to something her followers saw and liked in an artwork. Making tutorials for such followers was the first way in which she reacted to these curiosities. Her traditional art skills seemed to come in handy as she has the right mix of languages to be able to explain how painting works while using VR art tools.&nbsp;<br></p><p>As for style, it is interesting how much it changes if you were a traditional artist in a past life.&nbsp;“It’s gonna be different in each medium, right? The ideas can still be the same, but the style adapts itself to changing tools”.&nbsp;Sabby<em>&nbsp;</em>developed one specific style that can be considered unique in the way that it was her followers who took note of it - it’s been called the ‘Stained Glass’ style. An Instagram follower has been credited for naming this style, as she came to develop it in&nbsp;Tilt Brush&nbsp;across several works that she was sharing online. She also likes to use the<em>&nbsp;</em>Splatter Brush&nbsp;a fair bit. Sabby’s hope is that everyone creating in VR continues to expand their skills, as the tools keep being redesigned and evolve with you. When we asked about emerging VR art styles, she waived the concept of styles as a fleeting and temporary notion. She likes to privilege experimentation, an openness to keep on restyling, and like that constantly mature. She believes the same about her own style - that it keeps on advancing. With the plethora of new brushes to work with, plus the launch of up and coming apps - there’s plenty of room for play.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><em>“A lot of things in the beginning with VR art was trial and error for me”&nbsp;- and would be for anyone getting into this medium. As there are still only so many VR artists, Sabby&nbsp;believes that,&nbsp;“they’re kind of like experts already.&nbsp;Each of them, even within their own bandwidth, is actively discovering and applying their own style and knowledge - making marks and waves that don’t necessarily compare on an even plane.”&nbsp;</em></blockquote><h3><strong>The VRArtLive Community</strong>&nbsp;<br>‍<br></h3><p>Not long ago, we got in touch with some members from the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/blog/peek-into-vr-art-live-community">VRArtLive Community</a>&nbsp;to get a sneak peek into the<em>&nbsp;</em>2020 Daily Art Challenge,&nbsp;which began in January 2020. The&nbsp;VRA Community&nbsp;has been in place since Sabby<em>&nbsp;</em>decided to take her experience from her 365 Days Tilt Brush Challenge forward by bringing more creators on board with herself. As a Community Leader and Director, Sabby works alongside her team on the&nbsp;VRArtLive Discord<em>&nbsp;</em>where @AntiVi, @ReVerseButcher, @ZandyXR, @chromasnare, @Grrlrighter, @Willowmoon come together to curate events, exhibitions and talks. In all their pursuits the&nbsp;VRArtLive<em>&nbsp;</em>team hopes to remain approachable as guides to all levels of newcomers - to maintain the philosophy that everyone is welcome. The idea behind the&nbsp;2020 Daily Art Challenge&nbsp;is that every participant gets to choose a VR art app and a level of commitment - deciding to create artwork every single day for either a week, a month, or all of 2020.&nbsp;“We are calling it ‘Year of VR Art’ and it’s been really exciting!”&nbsp;said Sabby.<br></p><p>In Sabby's assessment - the community and its growth has made some initial lines easier for artists to cross - especially the fabled and feared&nbsp;‘art technique line’&nbsp;- as creators are able to find ways to move their old art around, and do new things with it in VR. Like Sabby<em>&nbsp;</em>was drawn to&nbsp;Tilt Brush&nbsp;as a painter, she finds that other artists with prior experience in other mediums are able to figure out their translated niche eventually.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="padding-bottom:56.206088992974244%" data-rt-type="video" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="" data-rt-max-height="56.206088992974244%" data-rt-dimensions="854:480" data-page-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KcCoPu3qDY&feature=emb_logo"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0KcCoPu3qDY"></iframe></div></figure><p>‍</p><p>The main focus of the&nbsp;VRArtLive&nbsp;community, Sabby<em>&nbsp;</em>tells us, is to do things and ‘be&nbsp;live’<em>&nbsp;</em>with it. Essentially composed of a generation of artists who aren’t shy about sharing, the community maintains a clear focus on learning and growing together. Members share live performances and/or create content for the web and discuss their workflow, findings, and challenges.&nbsp;“If you are in the community you get a lot of attention from me. It is very close to my heart - &nbsp;to share what I am learning and bring it along with me. I think this will strengthen the industry.”<em>&nbsp;</em>This community is able to be social through long-term projects, conversation threads, and resource pools where they’re always boosting each other and focusing on timely creation of VR art.&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote><em>“Everyone there is very happy to be a part of the VRArtLive Community, as far as I know. My team comes up with ideas, we get onto social media, organize events, and get people involved.”</em></blockquote><h3><strong><br>Onward and Upwards</strong><br></h3><p>On the subject of future plans, Sabby<em>&nbsp;</em>shared how she<em>&nbsp;</em>has been working on some business ideas outside of her role as a pioneer in the VR art industry. Art is her hobby-turned-career and she wishes to keep things in balance while scaling her audience. Her recent clients include&nbsp;Audi, Google, Vrscout, Disney, Pixar, and Lucasfilm (Microsoft).&nbsp;<br>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="padding-bottom:56.206088992974244%" data-rt-type="video" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="" data-rt-max-height="56.206088992974244%" data-rt-dimensions="854:480" data-page-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Vt5IrlMQUw&list=PLeARi-6vG-Z06FoPiUNkYA-fW_bpJFqt1"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Vt5IrlMQUw"></iframe></div></figure><blockquote><em>“I advise people interested in transitioning to VR to do their research, do their own experimentation and stay at it everyday.

    title: "Spotlight: Andy Baker on Ascribing Personality to Randomness",
    date: "Aug 05, 2021",

    content: `<p>Based in Brighton, UK, Andy Baker is an artist-developer who has “always been drawn towards more creative ends of tech, and probably the tech ends of the creative world”. For our November 2020 show called&nbsp;<em>Body Clock</em>&nbsp;we had the opportunity to work with Andy, specifically with the mathematical piece&nbsp;<em>Gossamer</em>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Andy Baker recalls how when he got his first computer ever - at age 12 - it was the IQ spectrum. And one of the first things he did was just draw patterns using little bits of software that drew patterns. And while no one else seemed even remotely interested in it, that might have been what led to an interest in technical drawing at school. Photography, mathematical patterns, and geometry compounded into a certain aesthetic for Andy over time, and led to continued experimentation.<br></p><blockquote>“I think when I started reading up on the advice I give to photographs, it's like don't be too symmetrical. Don't be too regular And I never liked that advice I'd always definitely towards a really formal, you know, dead on dead symmetrical kind of look. I love combining that regularity with broken things like eroded old things. And I think it's that combination of the kind of natural and the organic and the really geometric but that's my happy place.”<br></blockquote><p>Never too drawn to the gameplay element in games, Andy found that he was invested in the world-building that gaming made accessible. He wanted to explore and interpret these worlds, just drive around a city someone made or wander down geometric passages. And discovering VR brought more such opportunities. People were reimagining space for the purposes of wandering around the space. And such space, without gameplay mechanics in place and or a ‘need’ governing the architecture met Andy’s flight of fancy. While architecture might be one way to recognize a confluence of creativity and geometry, computational architecture also comes close - he notes.<br></p><p>Baker's very first VR experience was the early Tuscany demo on the Oculus DK1. And then Google Cardboard came out.&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>“When you finally tried a headset that was 6DoF, like head tracking, that suddenly made things so much more real, way more engaging, and so much more like actually being somewhere that you couldn't quite believe. I think the very first time I tried 6DoF stuff, it was with my friend who brought his Oculus DK 2 and I played Lucky's Tale, which is a really cute kind of Nintendo-ish platformer. And while playing that was when it first dawned on me that I could lean forward and look behind this fence. And it was just mind blowing!”<br></blockquote><p>Andy Baker’s primary tool is Unity, which has given him the opportunity to integrate almost everything he likes to tinker with - audio, Photoshop elements, 3D modeling and animation assets, code, and time-based sequences.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1920px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1920px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/mor-gossamer-screenshot-2-1.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div><figcaption>Visitors experiencing Gossamer in the MOR</figcaption></figure><p>‍<br></p><h4>Gossamer in the MOR<br></h4><p>Andy's original intention for Gossamer was that the colors would be more saturated, but the muted colours came to make more sense. A factor that was non-negitiable throughout the experimentation though was that he wanted -- blurry elements, real soft elements, and really sharp details playing off of each other. Finding a nice middle point where one can see a combination of the blurry and the really-sharp-middle-point became the goal. For a reference point, he had in mind that sense of perspective that one may have if they were looking through a microscope with massive depth of field. One iteration of the piece simulated this idea - such that if you moved closer to the piece, it would appear in focus and if you move further away things would get blurry. But that proved to be difficult to control.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The piece was created using a toolset and library for geometric forms. Baker saw the chance to combine that with some lovely political experiments that Keijiro Takahashi (Unity’s Wizard in Residence) had created. The photographic sense of ‘blurriness’ and the &nbsp;‘out of focus’ aesthetic was inspired by a beautiful work done in JavaScript a few years ago. Some part of it is based on what it looks like when there is morning condensation and how spider web forms catch the sun. The terrific thing is that it was entirely faked using code and just circles of different sizes.&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote><em>“I'd been meaning to try and do something similar myself when Keijiro released a really nice implementation. So just one morning, I grabbed that. And I grabbed my geometry toolset. And I tried mashing them all together. And it was just one of those times where it worked. And all of a sudden, I was in bed -- &nbsp;I was doing it all in bed on a Saturday morning -- and I suddenly realized that I made something that I really genuinely liked and would be happy to show to people, and to try and get out there.”&nbsp;</em><br></blockquote><p>When it came to the audio too, Andy’s friend, <a href="https://www.jamesrampton.uk/">James Rampton</a> offered to compose something. Just as a placeholder, he gave a piece (originally a vocal work) that was made up of just two chords. Andy really liked that asked that James compose a similar piece. In the current audio, there are perhaps three chords in three different sections that randomly switch around.<br></p><p>Another friend, <a href="https://speakersonstrings.com/wedo.html">Alan Jackson</a>, a sound artist and sound designer, added all the lovely strange tinkly, glasslike sounds that you can hear. And then there was discussion about if an algorithm could randomly change between the different sound elements, and dictate rules for how many elements can be allowed to play at the same time. For the sound to fit in with the visuals they had to be, again, sort of in tandem with the randomness. &nbsp;The gradual shifts in the visuals are such that the three shells change at different intervals with different speed settings.&nbsp;<em>Gossamer</em>&nbsp;will indeed be doing something new, with a beat of its own.<br></p><p>While one of the most precious outcomes in the piece is that the math and the randomization create a seamless loop, Andy sure<em>&nbsp;</em>hopes that viewers can occasionally spot a clear geometric form.&nbsp;<br></p><p><em>“You'll see a dodecahedron or you'll see a pyramid because they are indeed being traced by these particles. And then the whole thing is rotating using a kind of a Brownian motion sort of algorithm which makes the particles bend on curved paths. That is what obscures the underlying strict sort of geometric basis. These lovely curves and occasional clusters help where the animation speed doesn't move fast enough. So in the many layers, it starts with something rigid and mathematical to which I added a couple of different layers of randomness, with different flavors of randomness.&nbsp;</em><br></p><p><em>You can have pure noise which is quite harsh and you can have modulated sine waves that would still be random but they'd always have that wave-like element. You can have Brownian motion which feels a bit like watching you know, particles suspended in water, moving with an almost life-like movement.&nbsp;</em><br></p><p><em>“I think the guy that discovered Brownian motion thought that he was seeing living creatures, because it looks so emotional, looks directed, and looks like you know little creatures are moving around trying to do stuff. But that is actually just the work of our brains, ascribing personality to randomness when it come to question.”</em></p><div data-rt-embed-type='true'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hear <a href="https://twitter.com/andybak?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@andybak</a> share the many loves he has managed to combine, in the artwork &#39;Gossamer&#39; (2020) - <a href="https://t.co/En2OlAyO1b">pic.twitter.com/En2OlAyO1b</a></p>&mdash; Museum of Other Realities (MOR) (@MuseumOR) <a href="https://twitter.com/MuseumOR/status/1329567861627469824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>‍</p><p>Gossamer is a piece where the process itself is one of faith--let’s even call it a meditative exploration--without an exact guarantee of what the result might be. Andy shared how he got worried a few times while tweaking various parameters -- starting to get the anxiety that it was looking worse than before and that&nbsp;<em>un-tweaking</em>&nbsp;may not help revive the things that were right before.&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote><em>“Essentially it is a series of happy accidents, really. I mean, there's a sense that you learn over the years things that work and things that go together and you get a sense for, it's like kicking in, you chuck a load of stuff in the pot, and it's not entirely predictable how it's gonna come out you, you get a sense for what might work. At least that's how I cook!”</em><br></blockquote><p>We spoke about the opening night of ‘Body Clock’ attendees from which were crowding the room with Gossamer on display. We asked Andy what he felt about the reception the work has received.&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote><em>“My internet was playing up that night. And so, for the first quarter of an hour, I was a ghost and nobody could hear or see me. But I could listen. And so I listened to everyone talking about the piece of what they thought of it. In a way, &nbsp;it was a rather wonderful way to have that first public showing. I didn't have the self-consciousness and the embarrassment as people were saying nice and/or not so nice things. I could just lurk and listen. And it was great. People were really appreciative about it and I could feel my chest puffing with pride all the way. And then the headset suddenly fixed itself and I had to actually say hello to people.”</em><br></blockquote><p>On the subject of the future of VR, Andy felt certain that a lot more content creation tools and tools for artists are en route. He hopes that the new tech will come with a spirit of synergy, to let creates rolling in unexpected outcomes.&nbsp;<br></p><p>“So better workflows, more crazy combinations of stuff, more collaborations. And the audience itself! We need to get more people in headsets and show them how incredible VR works can be. Show them the things that cannot exist in any other medium.”<br></p><p>Andy’s advice to artists considering migrating to VR is that they spend as much time as they can in social VR, exploring things, downloading the weirdest demos they can. He believes that some of the now-forgotten work, work released in the initial stages of the current generation of VR. There are some wonderful narratives and many strange little experiments that he believes someone ought to curate and catalog before they get lost in the mists of time.<br></p><p>The final image that Andy left us with was how he lives in a house full of pictures of pugs.&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>“Even though we don't have a dog anymore. And I've got a herb garden that currently has no herbs in it, because they died and I'm the world's best gardener.”</blockquote><p>‍<br>Learn more about Andy Baker on his <a href="https://andybak.net/work">website.</a></p><p>—</p><p><em>The MOR Artist Spotlight series features creators using VR as an artistic tool or medium of expression.

    content: `<p>Alongside gaming and training, another area where the virtual reality (VR) shines is as a tool for creativity. The ability to navigate and operate within 3D space firsthand can feel more natural than pointing and clicking on a monitor. From sculpting to animating, there's a range of software for creating in VR. However, with how fast the industry changes, figuring out where to start can be daunting, so we compiled this list.</p><p>Note that the type of hardware you have might determine which apps you can use. For instance, all the apps mentioned here require headsets with six degrees of freedom (6DoF)—like the Oculus Rift S/Quest, HTC Vive, and Valve Index—which track both your rotation and position in 3D space as opposed to headsets with three degrees of freedom (3DoF)—like the Oculus Go—which only track your rotation. &nbsp;Also, most apps require <a href="https://www.oculus.com/rift-s/oculus-ready-pcs/">VR-ready PCs</a> to run and some are tied to specific app ecosystems. If you need a VR hardware guide, the folks at Gravity Sketch wrote a <a href="https://medium.com/@gravitysketch/virtual-reality-101-the-gravity-sketch-guide-to-vr-computers-and-the-best-vr-headsets-on-the-ae6eeaab1927">detailed blog post</a> to help you get started.</p><p>So without further ado, here's a few VR art-making software you might want to try (in no particular order):</p><h2><a href="https://quill.fb.com/">Quill</a></h2><p>Available on: Oculus Store (PC)</p><p>Ideal for: Illustration, Animation</p><p>Pricing: Free</p><p>Created during the production of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY46_hkY_-I">Dear Angelica</a>, Quill (by Facebook) lets users draw, paint, and animate on an 'infinite' canvas within a virtual 3D space. While it was initially made as a tool for painting and illustration, robust animation features were been added in their <a href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/quill-launches-vr-animation-and-storytelling-tools">2.0 update</a>.</p><p>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="padding-bottom:56.206088992974244%" data-rt-type="video" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-height="56.206088992974244%" data-rt-dimensions="854:480" data-page-url="https://youtu.be/oaI57-BnORA"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oaI57-BnORA"></iframe></div></figure><p>‍</p><p>Even though you’re technically working in 3D, animating in Quill differs from traditional 3D workflows in that it is less about modelling and rigging and more about hand-painted frame-by-frame animation. In this way, animating in Quill is a lot like working with stop-motion animation. Quill users can export files (video, 360, and 3D) for further processing, so it can easily fit into whatever creative workflow you already have in place.</p><p>‍</p><h2><a href="https://nvrmind.io/">AnimVR</a></h2><p>Available on: Steam, Oculus Store (PC), Viveport</p><p>Ideal for: Illustration, Animation </p><p>Pricing: Paid</p><p>Like Quill in many ways in terms of its drawing and animation capabilities, AnimVR offers more robust timeline features, import and export options, and camera handling, which means that you can do a lot more in VR without having to turn to software like Maya or Unity. Files can be easily passed between Quill and AnimVR (with occasional compatibility issues).</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="padding-bottom:56.206088992974244%" data-rt-type="video" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-height="56.206088992974244%" data-rt-dimensions="854:480" data-page-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hppjOQS1SOQ"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hppjOQS1SOQ"></iframe></div></figure><p>‍</p><p>AnimVR uses subscription pricing depending on which tier you fall into, though it does have a one-time fee option for personal and non-commercial use.</p><p>‍</p><h2><a href="https://www.tiltbrush.com/?ref=mor">Tilt Brush</a></h2><p>Available on: Oculus Store (PC and Quest), Steam, Viveport</p><p>Ideal for: Illustration, Performance</p><p>Pricing: Paid</p><p>Tilt Brush falls into a similar category of illustration apps as Quill. Although it doesn't have animation features, Tilt Brush comes with a variety of brushes that have textures and animated lighting effects such as fire or electricity, which can make your illustrations visually interesting without having to turn to different software to add extra flourishes.

These tools will improve over time, but until then, you can export your work and build upon them on desktop.</p><p>If you'd like to see more examples of mindbending artwork created in VR, you can visit the <a href="/">Museum of Other Realities</a> from the <em>comfort</em> of your headset.</p><p>‍</p>`

    content: `<p>My name is Colin Northway, I work on the Museum of Other Realities, and one of my roles is sound implementation. Today I'm going to talk about sound implementation for Durk van der Meer's piece, <em>Terrarium</em>.</p><p>Like many pieces we show in the MOR , <em>Terrarium </em>didn't come with a full sound-scape. Few visual artists are also confident sound designers but sound adds tremendously to the VR experience. We like to add audio whenever the artist is open to it.</p><p>We work with <a href="https://www.ashellinthepit.com/">A Shell in the Pit</a> Audio who does all the sound design for the museum and also the pieces we add audio to. They jumped into VR audio design very early and are an amazing team to work with. For Durk's piece, A Shell In The Pit had very little direction so Em Halberstadt had to make decisions about what needed sound, what to highlight, and what everything would sound like.</p><p>Every art piece in the MOR goes through a draft staging period where we have the rough layout of the room and the artwork's position in it. From there we get feedback from the artist as we move towards final staging. This drafting process also gives A Shell in the Pit a chance to drink in the piece and get a feel for what the artist is trying to convey and how to compliment it.</p><p>In this case, Em decided to break <em>Terrarium </em>into two ambiences, a spot sound and one stereo-split music track:</p><ul><li>Ambience for the top floor</li><li>Ambience for the bottom floor</li><li>Spot sound for the Amp on the bottom floor</li><li>Track for the left wall-mounted speaker</li><li>Track for the right wall-mounted speaker</li></ul><p>The Museum of Other Realities uses Moona to manage all of our audio. Moona is a Shell in the Pit tool written by Maris Tammik and Nicholas Zhang which is especially good at managing sound for VR projects. It manages all our disparate sounds, sounds being on the other side of portals, walls occluding sound, a bunch of tricks for making conversation more natural, and a lot more.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img alt="Audio placement and colliders in  Terrarium" src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/terrairum-sound-positions.gif"></div><figcaption>Audio placement and colliders in <em>Terrarium</em></figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>Usually, my job of audio implementation is really easy, I just have to drag some Moona assets into the right place in Unity and let Moona do its magic. For <em>Terrarium</em>, we had a slightly more technical challenge implementing the ambiences between the top and bottom floors.</p><p>In Moona, sounds radiate from a point and can be heard anywhere within hearing distance. This means sounds are "spherical shaped". But the bottom and top of <em>Terrarium </em>meet in a line and are right next to each other. Meaning spherical sounds are hard to place to cover one floor without bleeding into the other.</p><p>The solution to this was to use box-shaped colliders to bound in the sounds. Moona lets us turn sounds on and off when the visitor's head is inside of certain boxes, for <em>Terrarium </em>I made one for the top and one for the bottom. These let the visitor hear the ambience slowly rise as they appear the piece but also flip back and forth more suddenly as they move up and down the stairs. To make the transition between top and bottom smooth, Nicholas Zhang added a fade transition between the two sounds.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/terrairum-sound-1-small-light-v2.gif"></div></figure><p><em>Terrarium </em>also has one of my favorite strange VR audio tricks in it with the left, right speaker tracks. Durk put a video preview of his personal project Maranga to the bottom room and added two speakers on the wall. Em decided to add audio to the Maranga video but to make it in stereo with different tracks for each speaker. This is a strange, wonderful thing. All the environment audio in the MOR is spatialized. This means it's mathematically transformed to sound as if it's coming from behind or beside or above you. Stereo sound is part of spatializing but not the whole equation. In the bottom floor of <em>Terrarium</em>, you are hearing two stereo tracks further spatialized into three-dimensional space. To my surprise, it works amazingly well and adds such a strange verisimilitude.</p><p>‍</p>`

    content: `<p>This is the first in our 'Behind the Scenes' series exploring what goes into building the Museum of Other Realities (MOR). Last month, we introduced three new exhibits, each with exciting challenges and requirements. With six new wearable dresses in <em>Tilt Couture,</em> virtual flora in <em>Lignes de Fleurs,</em> and the futuristic cityscape of <em>Alex's Sci-Fi World,</em> here's a peek behind the curtain of last month's update.</p><h2>TILT COUTURE</h2><p>An animation designer and fashion illustrator, <a href="http://hulabunny.com/">Anand Duncan's</a> dresses have been a part of the MOR for a long time. For the August update, we wanted to place her fashion work on the center stage (literally), especially with her new <em>Neon Metropolis Gown</em> on display. Anand works in the VR illustration software, <a href="https://www.tiltbrush.com/">Tilt Brush</a>, so there were a few things we had to address during implementation.</p><p>To begin with, we ran an optimization pass on all the dresses, swapping out a Tiltbrush shader with a custom MoR shader that allows us to add highlights and a bit more materiality to the dresses. Since they can be worn by visitors, the dresses needed to be easily distinguishable throughout the gallery, against both light or dark backgrounds, in a similar way to how we render our avatars.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:600px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="600px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/neon-metropolis-gown-reduced.gif"></div></figure><p>The newest dress, <em>Neon Metropolis Gown</em> called for a cloth-like effect. Regarding implementation, Lindsay Jorgensen, Technical Artist at the MOR, says:</p><p>"Running cloth simulation is likely to be too computationally cumbersome in respect to all we have going on, so we went with a simple effect where we split the model into top and bottom elements, then 'skinned' the bottom of the dress. By adding a script that uses a 'SmoothDamp' function to lag the position and rotation of that control bone, we are able to give the dress a swishy, twirly effect. We are also able to get the rotational velocity out of this which we then use to control the audio."</p><p>In addition to optimizing the dresses, another important part of the process was staging; figuring how best to showcase these dresses. We went for the showroom experience, installing a jumbotron (or mirror) and a runway for visitors to strut across.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1500px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1500px"><div><img alt="Tilt Couture wide 1.jpg" src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/tilt-couture-wide-1.jpeg"></div></figure><p>A major consideration with the room design was ensuring it elevates, rather than detracts from, the dresses and the experience. So we focused on using a simple design, leveraging lights and bloom without being overpowering.</p><h2>LIGNES DE FLEURS</h2><p>This selection of pieces comes from an ongoing daily project by <a href="https://www.thesabbylife.com/">Sabby Lighf</a> called <em>365 Days of Tilt Brush,</em> in which she is determined to master VR illustration. For Sabby, flora has always been a source of intrigue, not only as an influence on her art but also in terms of the feelings they evoke in her. The patterns in <em>Lignes de Fleurs</em> were inspired by the striations and textures in plants on a microscopic level, so an important part of staging the room was ensuring that these details were apparent to the visitor in the MOR.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1155px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1155px"><div><img alt="Lignes de fleurs room.png" src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/lignes-de-fleurs-room.png"></div></figure><p>We extracted some key elements from the plant pieces and placed them in ‘planters’ while letting them spread and take root. Em Halberstadt, from <a href="https://www.ashellinthepit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Shell in the Pit</a>, then implemented audio in relation to each plant biome. This has the benefit of grounding the pieces, making them more integrated within the museum, as opposed to having them simply float in space. Like the dresses in <em>Tilt Couture</em>, the pieces in <em>Lignes de Fleurs</em> required some script-level optimizations. We ran a decimation operation on their geometry while making sure to not lose mapping information or details such as the stroke types used in the original artwork.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:600px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="600px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/lignes-de-fleur-gif-smaller.gif"></div></figure><p>The butterfly piece was where we found some scope to play. The long wavy lines were adapted with a special shader that added some transparency and motion. This created an airy feeling, allowing users to pass through less jarringly. We extracted the elements from the wings and animated them to flap when triggered randomly. With this, we could then set up a special volume with the script to temporarily attach a copy of the wings to visitors for a brief amount of time when they move through the butterflies. Along with the dresses, this type of avatar customization is something we'd love to explore more in the future.</p><h2>ALEX'S SCI-FI WORLD</h2><p>The inclusion of Product Designer, <a href="http://www.mattschaeferdesign.com/">Matt Shaefer's</a> <em>Alex's Sci-Fi World</em> coincided with a pretty big <a href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/quill-launches-vr-animation-and-storytelling-tools/?fbclid=IwAR3XoTyJhuC_fdSwwefEenTull91mEqeYN1oQeD_NJ7S7MUdhkG-YAOFYyk">update to Quill</a>, the VR illustration and animation tool used to create the piece. This update added a bunch of animation features to Quill, and in turn, Matt updated the piece to take advantage of these features. As a result, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTl8kpCn4ls">this phase</a> of <em>Alex's Sci-Fi World</em> features new micro-stories and feels much more alive.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:600px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="600px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/sci-fi-world-dolly.gif"></div></figure><p>Though we were intent on including the animated elements from the piece into the museum, the mere size of the data required made it impractical to fully adapt the piece in all its glory. We even experimented with an Alembic export, since the file format supports animated meshes, but we ran into similar issues. Our solution was to export a single frame from the piece and group elements within it into separate, more manageable, chunks. With the artist sending us a more simplified version of the scene (thanks, Matt!), we ran decimation on the models and made material adjustments. Fortunately, we were able to implement some simple animations with a script that iterates over a series of objects, enabling each one in sequence to recreate a similar animation from the original piece. In the future, we hope to recreate more animations, but since Quill doesn't export data of that nature, this is a manual process.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1500px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1500px"><div><img alt="Alex's Sci Fi World Outside Portal.png" src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/alexs-sci-fi-world-outside-portal.png"></div></figure><p>In terms of staging, we wondered "What if we also brought parts of the piece from within the portal into the museum?". By changing the rendering 'layer' setting in Unity we were able to take some elements and render them, both in the museum and beyond the portal. Having elements from the piece in the room feels more inviting, almost guiding the visitor towards a portal they might have otherwise missed.</p><h2>OTHER UPDATES</h2><p>You may have noticed a subtle update to the teleportation mechanic in the MOR. But if you didn't (because <em>subtle</em>), we added a bit of momentum to the pointer. Now it feels slightly more like a fishing line on a rod than a laser-pointer. Since teleportation is the primary mode of locomotion for most visitors in the MOR, this is one step towards making the mechanic feel more natural, fun, or at the very least comfortable.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img alt="Before" src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/teleport-update-before.gif"></div><figcaption>Before</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img alt="After" src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/teleport-update-after.gif"></div><figcaption>After</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>We'd love to hear what you think about it!

He started out mid-1990's as comic artist, illustrator and poster designer, and went via DTP into 3D animation. In 2001 he founded the computer animation studio Happy Ship, with which he rolled into the VFX business, fully animated productions, and more recently VR development.<br><br>As a solo artist, he's fully committed to using VR as both a new tool and a new medium of expression and, more essentially, world-building. He's currently working on A Piece Of The Universe, a personal diorama made in VR, for VR.

No. Fun. At. All. Except when working.</p><p>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:940px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="940px"><div><img alt="ARTIST SPOTLIGHT - Naam .png" src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/artist-spotlight-naam.png"></div></figure><p>‍</p><h4><strong>Tell us a bit about yourself. What’s your background?</strong></h4><p>Sure, let's start with the hardest questions first! Who am I. Hmmm.</p><p>I've been a visual tinkerer all my life (fabrication year 1972), started out drawing, painting, making comics. When picking between art and physics for a higher education, art seemed so much more romantic, but I only endured art college for a year and a few months – too much focus on the babble-behind-the-art for my liking. I just wanted to make pretty things! Meaning should flow from the work, not be explained in a separate medium. </p><p>So I went and started doing my own thing, started creating an income for myself in illustration, and found a neat youth center where I could make the posters and magazine for all their activities and concerts. This got me into DTP when that was first developing, and that lead to tinkering with digital and 3D animation when that slowly became accessible in the nineties. When approached to make a 3D animated movie around 2000, because Maxon (the makers of Cinema4D) liked what I was doing, I founded Happy Ship with Martin Venema and Harry Arling, and I've been running that ever since. We slid from 3D animation into VFX, mainly for dutch film and television. But we've always tried to strike a balance between commercial projects and artistic ones. We've done interactive installations, theater, and obviously were eager to dive into VR when that arrived on the consumer market.</p><p>What VR also brought, though, for me personally, was an incredible new medium for personal expression! I've always been an artist and tinkerer on the side – learned myself how unity worked just out of interest, and to scratch a programming-itch. Now with VR, you could not only step into your own creations, but also interact with them. All kinds of different skills I developed with my tinkering seemed to fall into place and connect themselves up!</p><h4><strong>What does your average day look like?</strong></h4><p>That so much depends on what we're working on! Sometimes, my average day is 100% animating, or modelling, or programming, for hours on end. Very often it is juggling a few projects at once, creating some myself and managing others. And then sometimes it's things like sitting in on a script reading session for a theater play. </p><p>But the days I love most are the private tinkering days – usually in the weekends. I have a few private projects running now, all without any official pressure. Running a studio and doing commercial and/or team-based projects is super incredible, but there's always a LOT of compromise involved. I use these personal projects to counter that with a generous dollop of idiosyncraticness (for lack of a better term : ). Those are the days where you can just decide, over your morning coffee, what seems neat to try out. Could be a snowy forest to walk through, or an idea for an interaction mechanic. And I'm just lost for hours building my private little worlds and ideas, feeling them out almost-for-real in VR, tweaking atmospherics to get a certain mood. I am completely lost in those days, and I love it.</p><h4><strong>How did you get into creating VR work? Do you remember your first experience?</strong></h4><p>Of course I remember my first VR experience! Who doesn't? </p><p>A conspirator of ours had ordered the DK1, and, really, simply showed us the good ol’ &nbsp;Tuscany demo. I distinctly remember standing on the second floor landing, looking at the ceiling, down the stairs, and realizing how things like proximity, distance, height, were suddenly like new palette colours to paint with! Even better, I saw how simple it should be to start playing with these colours myself! All that lonesome hobby-tinkering with Unity and code meant that my skillset should allow me to create worlds. Interaction! Life! Out of thin air!</p><p>I think I ordered my own DK1 a day later.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:600px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="600px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/lunch-dolly-small-reduced.gif"></div><figcaption><a href="/artwork/lunch"><em>Lunch </em></a>(2017) created by Naam in Quill</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><h4><strong>From your personal projects to your work in the MOR, you seem to have some experience with a wide range of VR art tools, which do you use most often and why?</strong></h4><p>Actually, I think I am quite peculiar about my tools. I'm completely in love both with Quill and Google blocks, because they're both so incredibly no-frills: you're given just a few very basic, almost rudimentary tools to work with, and the space to work in, and that's it. You need to do all the groundwork yourself. Being an (I would say) comic artist, this so clicks with me. The way this forces you to focus on the 'essence' of an object or scene, instead of on all the little details. You know you can turn a slab into wood by just cutting out one or two suggestive creases? Or into cloth by a single well-placed wrinkle? And in VR, it's amazing to feel your lizard-brain react like "yup! that's made of wood now". This suggestiveness was, for me, one of the most amazing discoveries in VR: you really only need just enough suggestion to trick your brain into filling out the materiality of the world. It's amazing.<br> &nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Walk us through your process. For instance, you have a new idea for a scene, a forest that you want players to explore. Where do you start?</strong></h4><p>The forest, actually, is based on a mental image that haunted me after seeing The Revenant. Things usually start out like that: just a mental picture that keeps coming back to me, usually of a landscape, a view, a situation, and I don’t know exactly why it lingers. Trying to replicate it is the process of finding out what fascinates me about it!</p><p>I usually dive straight into Blocks, don't sketch out anything. This makes me treat the sketches like the model, and vice versa, and because of VR tools being so intuitive to work with, I can simply try out what works, throw away what doesn’t, all while working on the model that might very well become the finalized scene. </p><p>I try and take a modular approach, split the scene into reusable elements, but I always create a set of objects, sometimes a whole diorama, never a single asset at a time. Maybe just to discover relations between objects. </p><p>I run that through some mesh processing in Cinema4D, then they go straight into Unity to fill in the scenes, add atmosphere and lighting, and sound. Especially when working on a new scene to be in, I try and add all elements from the get-go – graphics, sound, post effects, atmosphere, motion – because they're all so important to the overall <em>feel</em> of a scene. Then it's a matter of tweaking everything until it clicks into place, and simply <em>being</em> there, hanging around, and feeling out what should be the next step. If a place clicks, it usually suggests the next step all by itself: that thing you feel like you’re missing is so easy to magic into existence.</p><h4><strong>Let's talk about ‘A Piece of the Universe’ (APOTU). The detail you've put into this is mind-blowing. What is it and how did the project come about?</strong></h4><p>I tend to get inspiration from my peers, when I see someone doing great work it motivates me to do the same. It always starts with a vague idea, I try not to over detail it in my head or it tends to destroy the joy of exploring the development of the piece, the more I can improvise on the spot the better. The rest is a lot of work, I tend to enjoy the first 10% of a piece and the last 10%. The beginning is fun, you spend a lot of time setting up the visual style, it's rough, it happens quickly and it's new every minute. Then the next 80% is just a lot of rendering out the details, filling the gaps and trying to perfect the form, this is a bit boring for me. The last 10% is really fun, this is when the piece is mostly done and you want to add flavor to it, you can also try to be creative and add things on top to make it stand out. I basically enjoy the process of creating, not so much the process of building, I imagine I will enjoy it the most when we can conjure up images with our brains instantly through computer to brain interfaces.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1014px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1014px"><div><img alt="A screenshot from A Piece of The Universe. Courtesy of Naam." src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/backofcaravan.png"></div><figcaption>A screenshot from A Piece of The Universe. Courtesy of Naam.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><h4><strong>Why did you choose to go with a low-poly, handcrafted visual style in APOTU? It’s interesting because there’s this idea that photo-realism is central to imbuing a sense of presence and immersion, but your work shows that there’s a lot more to it.</strong></h4><p>There was never really a choice to do so. Because of the click between my usual drawing style and the low-poly nature of Blocks, it was simply the best way to quickly create and try stuff out about that scene. I was amazed myself how <em>real</em> it all felt once I added the more atmospheric elements – the sound, the haze, the horizon, the wide open spaciousness of those low-hanging clouds. I so remember the first time I added the cars, that's when everything clicked. it was a world, and the suggestion that there were others around made it so much stronger. That first tweet of those cars, and the reactions, also suggested that it worked for others as it did for me. </p><p>A convincing VR world is not about realism at all. I feel that it's about connection – you need an intuitive connection to the virtual world. Suggestions for your lizard-brain. The size and height of object being exactly how you'd expect them, for example. The interplay between objects in strong sunlight. The affordances of objects being what you expect, even if abstracted. That doorknobs you can grab are of a size that would feel good in your hand. If you get details like that right, there are SO MANY other aspects that you can leave out completely. Texture doesn't matter if shape already suggests material perfectly, and you only need three visible nails to suggest that a fence contains tons of them. The brain already believes it, no need to re-confirm its suspicions.</p><h4><strong>I'm curious about your decision to host APOTU on</strong><a href="http://itch.io/"><strong> Itch.io</strong></a><strong> as opposed to storefronts like Steam or Oculus. What motivated this?</strong></h4><p>I'm not a game maker. I'm treating APOTU as a playpen for ideas, and have yet to find a bigger, overarching plan with it – it's actually still called a "prototype for APOTU". It's super important to me that this world remains free of external demands for now – I've only enabled the donation option on Itch after players kept asking me to do so, so amazed by the response! If I'd throw it on Steam or offer it at Oculus, it would feel, for now, way too much like a promise I'm making: "Yes this will become a full blown explore-em-up someday". I cannot do that without feeling guilty for spending only my free time on it.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1439px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1439px"><div><img alt="A screenshot from The Rat King. Courtesy of Naam." src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/rat-king-screenie.png"></div><figcaption>A screenshot from The Rat King. Courtesy of Naam.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><h4><strong>As someone who uses VR for creating and exhibiting, where do you see the medium heading into the future?</strong></h4><p>As a creative tool, it's here to stay. It's so quick to work when you don't have to judge an object's merit from an awkward projection on a 2D surface. With VR, you immediately see what's off. Heck even only the fact that you can stick your hand through it to edit the backside without having to navigate anything. The thing is just there, and you grab it.</p><p>As a medium, I so hope that we're going to see less gaming-centric projects for it. It's such an incredible medium for <em>play</em>, that it's disheartening to see how often that simply gets auto-translated to <em>gaming</em>, with all the trappings that come from that – edgy bombasstic scifi and fantasy worlds where designs get ever more weird and idiotic because practically everything has been tried already. </p><p>Especially for VR, I'm a firm believer that mundanity could lead to so much more engaging experiences. Ground your visitor in your world, make sure the basics are right, put them at ease, have them go at their own pace. If you get that right, and <em>then</em> introduce the fantastical, the effect is truly awe-inducing.</p><h4><strong>Do you have any tips or advice for people looking to get into creating VR art?</strong></h4><p>There's so many aspects to it, it's hard to summarize a best approach. The creation tools are so accessible, it's really a matter of trying it out, putting in some time to get the best out of the tools. If you're aiming to develop convincing scenes to be experienced within VR, keep in mind the power of mundanity. And if you're into creating tools, please please PLEASE try and think up VR-centric interaction! Don't think two-dimensional, display-based schemes are good and intuitive – we only went and got used to them! VR isn't about "oh let's add a color palette! That you can hold!" It's about "Whoa! We can squish paint out of tubes now!"</p><h4><strong>Where can we find out more about you and your work?</strong></h4><p>I so need some kind of hub site!

    content: `<p>Having worked with companies like Unity, Tiltbrush, GoogleVR and others, Cesar Ortega is an artist passionate about creating and designing with virtual reality. In this week’s spotlight, Ortega talks about his experience working with VR art tools, along with the benefits and challenges that come with working in a new medium.</p><p>‍</p><h3>FAST FACTS</h3><p><strong>Pronouns: </strong></p><p>He, him</p><p><strong>Based in: </strong></p><p>Miami, Florida</p><p><strong>Hobbies:</strong></p><p>Art</p><p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong></p><p>Although I studied Game Design I don't like to play games that much.</p><p>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img alt="ARTIST SPOTLIGHT - Cesar Ortega.png" src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/artist-spotlight-cesar-ortega.png"></div></figure><p>‍</p><h4><strong>Tell us a bit about yourself. What’s your background?</strong></h4><p>I am a 3D artist with a great love for VR. I have a Bachelors in Game Art and Design from the Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale in Florida. I started making art when I was very young, I take after my family, who have all been very accomplished artists in many disciplines, from music, painting to sculptures and more. I started drawing when I was very young, then moved to painting on canvas and then to digital illustration when I first moved to the US and got access to a computer, eventually I also picked up 3D modeling before officially starting my career. I love experimenting with visual styles and themes, as well as making epic pieces of art to inspire awe in my viewers.</p><h4><strong>What went into your decision to study game art and design?</strong></h4><p>At the time I believed it was the best path to learn how to make video games, though mostly it was about learning how to design and create assets that would go into games.</p><h4><strong>How did you get into creating VR art?</strong></h4><p>I was working at a studio doing traditional 3D work, a coworker came up to me and showed me a video of Glen Keane doing his famous Ariel painting in Tilt Brush. I was so captivated by the potential of VR I decided to get a VR headset of my own with Tilt Brush. </p><p>My traditional 3D art always had a focus on digital sculpting, this necessitated having a good understanding of shapes/forms and space which I believe directly translated to my success with VR painting since the same skill set and state of mind aid each other. I began making Tilt Brush sketches 3 years ago and I received a lot of support from the Tilt Brush team. This really motivated me to keep working and exploring VR, leading me to try out new applications like Gravity Sketch and eventually Blocks and all the others.</p><h4><strong>What tools do you use?</strong></h4><p>I use an ensemble of tools for creating art, for my traditional 3D artwork I use 3Ds Max, Vray, Zbrush, Substance Painter, Photoshop, After Effects and Unity. For my VR art, I use Tilt Brush, Blocks, Unity, gravity Sketch, Medium, and many others. The reason for choosing these tools I believe is arbitrary in most cases for the majority of artists, I believe most people learn tools that they encounter early on in their path and only find reasons to use others later on in the game, but they rather not switch because they are too knowledgeable/comfortable in what they know. In traditional 3D software there really aren't many limitations, most of the major tools can do it all, some are just slightly better than others. In VR is the opposite, most tools tend to only be good at one thing, due to the fact that they are still early in their dev cycle, the features are still limited, because of this I have learned and practice with most of them.<br> &nbsp;</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2500px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2500px"><div><img alt="Ortega’s ‘Solve et Coagula’ (2018) on display in the Museum of Other Realities.

Illustrated in Tilt Brush.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><h4><strong>You mention that many artists don't switch tools because they're already comfortable with the ones they already use. Have you received any skepticism about VR tools from traditional artists/creatives?</strong></h4><p>I have received skepticism personally and I have seen much online as well, most people who haven't tried VR are still under the impression that it's either a gimmick or a fad, you will hear comments like "It will never replace &lt;Insert industry standard&gt;". It's impossible to convince people otherwise with just words when they have never tried it, when I can, I simply try to get people to use VR, most change their minds immediately. VR is an experience that cant be sold on paper, it needs to be experienced first hand.</p><h4><strong>Could you describe your creative process?</strong></h4><p>I tend to get inspiration from my peers, when I see someone doing great work it motivates me to do the same. It always starts with a vague idea, I try not to over detail it in my head or it tends to destroy the joy of exploring the development of the piece, the more I can improvise on the spot the better. The rest is a lot of work, I tend to enjoy the first 10% of a piece and the last 10%. The beginning is fun, you spend a lot of time setting up the visual style, it's rough, it happens quickly and it's new every minute. Then the next 80% is just a lot of rendering out the details, filling the gaps and trying to perfect the form, this is a bit boring for me. The last 10% is really fun, this is when the piece is mostly done and you want to add flavor to it, you can also try to be creative and add things on top to make it stand out. I basically enjoy the process of creating, not so much the process of building, I imagine I will enjoy it the most when we can conjure up images with our brains instantly through computer to brain interfaces.</p><h4><strong>How do you share your work? Do you usually intend for people to view your art on flat screens or in headsets?</strong></h4><p>Almost all my art is meant to be experienced in VR, I take great care in designing the space and how the viewer will experience the piece. This means that it does not always look the way I intended it to on flat screens which, sadly, is how most people experience it. But I don't want to change that. I feel these tools’ strengths are that you can build your work to be experienced in a way no other medium can.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="padding-bottom:56.25%" data-rt-type="video" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-height="56.25%" data-rt-dimensions="0:0"><div><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iJnbVJB2PNM?wmode=opaque&enablejsapi=1" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></figure><p>‘The Peacock’s Tail’ by Ortega . Illustrated in Tilt Brush</p><h4><strong>What do you think is the future of VR art creation ?</strong></h4><p>I have always been very optimistic about the future of design inside VR. It really solves many issues that traditional mouse and keyboard inherently possess. The access to Z-depth in both vision and hand control in design can't be underestimated, it allows for a much easier time on tasks that are typically very time-consuming in traditional 3D like kitbashing, world building, rigging, animation, and set design. These are just the ones we have seen so far, I also predict that other things like retoping, hair grooming (guides), particle simulations with vector fields, and even foliage creation will also be made easier as more developers expand VR to cover more traditional 3D practices. Of course there are many challenges, VR, even though it makes these things easier mentally it does not physically, VR may never be as efficient as mouse and keyboard &nbsp;when it comes to the body, the strain in your eyes/head/neck/shoulders can be a real struggle especially considering how time-consuming all these tasks are. Despite all the limitations I feel that we will soon see the potential truly flourish as more professional artists and studios pick up these great tools.</p><h4><br><strong>With that in mind, what needs to happen for these VR tools to become more prominent in creative industries? </strong></h4><p>Developers need to treat them like so and spend time/money getting it into the hands of skeptical artists/companies. I feel like they should find accomplished artists in their respective industries who are willing to try it and send them a VR system for a month and have them play with the tools. I was personally convinced to get my VR headset from just a video for the sole purpose of creating art, to this day the majority of my hours in VR are all on art tools, almost none on games. I have tried to bring the idea to some devs that try to cater their tools to a more mainstream gaming audience or in other words casual users, that when it comes to art there are no casual users, either someone picks up the tools and runs with them because they love them or they try them once and never use them again, which is to say I believe making them appealing enough for a casual audience doesn't mean that you will get many artists using the tool often, even if it seems like more people have tried it.</p><h4><strong>Do you have any tips or advice for people looking to get into creating VR art?</strong></h4><p>No better time than now, VR is not going anywhere and it's only going to get better. Don’t stress what tool to pick up first, find the one whose visual style speaks to you and just start using it. You can learn any of these tools in a couple of weeks or less.</p><h4><strong>Where can we find out more about you and your work?</strong></h4><p>You can find me on all social media @3Donimus, I am very active on <a href="https://twitter.com/3Donimus">twitter </a>and my DM's are open, feel free to message me anytime.

He is the co-curator for <a href="https://ellephant.org/">ELLEPHANT</a> gallery's <a href="https://ellephant.org/exhibitions/upcoming/">ongoing VR Program</a> and is also the guest curator for the upcoming VR Art exhibition organized by <a href="https://artmur.com/">Galerie Art Mûr</a> in Montreal.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="padding-bottom:56.206088992974244%" data-rt-type="video" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="" data-rt-max-height="56.206088992974244%" data-rt-dimensions="854:480" data-page-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1stgpy0qvE"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P1stgpy0qvE"></iframe></div></figure><p><a href="https://www.samuelab.com/portfolio-xr-architecture/mor"><br>Revisiting</a> that tour led us down a design process rabbit-hole, and so here we are submerging ourselves to give you a short trip through some of our favorite design outcomes.

Perhaps this is a lesser known fact that The MOR was then called ‘Th-er’. As the design concept had to be fitting for<em> "an extravagant art style, that is the style of VR art", </em>the broad ambition they kicked off with was for <em>"something as revolutionary as the content the museum would hold"</em>. This blog-piece focuses on the collaboration with Samuel and borrows some of what he shared during the tour. <br>‍<br><br>Naturally everything began with drawings. A good number of sketches had to be produced, which were shared back and forth with the discussion lasting nearly four months.</p><blockquote>“After four months of exchanging ideas and sharing concepts, there was a clear handoff when I sent the final model. Robin evolved it for roughly a year into an expanded functional space, while borrowing some of the concepts and keeping some of the core spaces, especially the Grand Room where users spawn and the "courtyard" where <a href="http://www.kevinmackart.com/">Kevin Mack's</a> art is located.”<br></blockquote><p>The conceived design was aesthetically majestic yet with leeway and room to swell with the delightful demands of VR art in its sprawls.&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://silverstringmedia.com/">Claris Cyarron</a>, who works in architecture practice, and<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://kanawha.design">&nbsp;Katie Davis Sayles</a>&nbsp;are two other key individuals credited for helping formulate some of the early ideas, and for sharing feedback after the conceptual phase respectively.<br></p><blockquote>“I actually met Robin and Colin for the first time in my ‘<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.samuelab.com/portfolio-xr-architecture/cultvralgallery">CULTVRAL</a>’ gallery in AltSpaceVR. After that, they invited me to ‘Th-er’ and I became a regular.”<br></blockquote><p>Samuel has been working on VR art spaces for a while, with a focus on metaverse architecture and art. A prior experience with&nbsp;<em>AltSpaceVR&nbsp;</em>is further evidence of his time speculating gallery spaces to innovate new modalities for VR architecture. He led a unique&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://artahack.io/projects/metaverse-art-gallery/">art hackathon</a>&nbsp;with the goal of making a platform called CULTVRAL. To test the platform, he made the CULTVRAL Gallery in VR and used it to host his own gallery in VR. Eventually, with a grant from AltSpaceVR there were efforts to develop an app for Samuel as the main user.&nbsp;For Samuel the goal was to be able to host public VR art shows and make the platform available to anyone.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/8qeatnccqki5gomchwwhjbd9s24y4sblbusryyodpspwnvlxs-hmew7ym0g59zcuyzzc5fn9covxpca-esja57-6zaihweerd3_szjgivdel3oqhuszqjj1-h9ad-gfmwtxskapu.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div><figcaption>Waves - Cultural VR Art Gallery, 2017<br></figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/ggsafjuwfkdcxrt1vceubqqc-gbivfedstknfsmxsnwblajbulask3fibb30jlkza3fd43nvovlqndfx9vujdvb7u79girt0ia91ukiws7mbzwvybd2d-c4t6hcjp1klf3vuwadu.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div><figcaption>Room 1 - Cultural VR Art Gallery, 2017</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>The project ended prematurely and AltSpaceVR shut down, but one could say that this project did the needful in manifesting a collaboration between Samuel and The MOR. Having also tested theories about art spaces using some of his own art in collaboration with other VR art galleries, makes his methodology span the full length and breadth.&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>“I have my own art practice, where I create architectural spaces that could only exist in VR; spaces that are dreamy, beautiful and impossible to build in real life. Then I fill these rooms with my own VR sculptures. It’s art made in VR for VR, combined with spaces that are tailor made for VR and aesthetic hedonism.”&nbsp;<br></blockquote><p>A combination of structural principles were put in order, borrowing from Samuel and Robin’s design backgrounds, the outcomes can be seen as a coalescing of a pretty specific blend of expertise. Using some of the notes that Samuel shared with us, and the structure of the tour he led, this article covers some aspects of the design process.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The number of considerations that came up, as Samuel notes, often quickly led to thinking about work-arounds that can tackle challenges specific to immersed spaces. To be able to effectively arrive at these junctures also required lateral thinking, detrimental for conceiving an experiential perspective, for immersed viewership.<br></p><blockquote>“I want to talk about the limitations in the settings of the Museum of Other Realities. In real reality, there are limitations like budget, site, context, ownership, client, needs of the project, materials, gravity - to name a few. Just being able to buy anything too, having to pay for a bunch of concrete... to form it, to think about where all the wires will go... and all of that.”</blockquote><p>So for the MOR, those constraints were discounted but then replaced by other obscure constraints. And the thing with constraints is that they form the basis for some of the design itself, as the solutions grow their roots around the constraints.<br></p><p>The workflow had to be experimentally drawn out. It began with collecting inspiration images that turned into sketches. Trying to obtain specific lighting effects using reference images made a lot of the effort focus on spatial relationships like expansion and contraction. Below are some visual examples of the effect Samuel wanted light openings to produce when a wall touched the floor.&nbsp;“We wanted it to almost suggest an entire other world below the floor, or a sky opening in the ground”, Samuel explained. What would otherwise be a check for a strong, structural base for a wall in this design was perceived as a frail opening, leading viewers to seemingly experience even 'instability' as a form of freedom.<br></p><blockquote>“In the first phase, I was exploring corridors, linear networks of rooms expanding and contracting, altering between darkness and light. I was thinking a lot about the section of the corridor and how it could naturally harvest the indirect light from the sun and light the art inside in an interesting way.”</blockquote><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/biu38g5xmf-o8fdf-ppwcbl6fprx92wt5hidhsh4zrgdz7z1t-kgxvqphhteu-0b7pdbqfhsvshockkkp4vbozifbcbocownsojj5-yzm3k4rxsgqhnwbyyprpeq-0gnbglxlgeo.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div><figcaption>Saint Benedict Abbey, Quebec -- Architect Dan Hanganu</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><blockquote>“It's important to establish that the strategy was really to give The MOR a toolbox to create a gallery of infinite possibilities, a toolset they can use almost parametrically. So it was deliberate from the beginning to go into this categorization for design sessions. And then at the end, I made some more concrete spaces that were all connected. That way there is a solid core appropriate for guest arrival and a knowledge base as to how to expand that core to infinity.”<br></blockquote><p>Then there came a phase when the rooms and doorways became the focus. In a way, the museum was unfolding itself as the systems being conceived and starting to make sense as an expanse. At one point, the talks shifted to conceptualizing a hall. At this point, Samuel looked into what&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>makes</em>&nbsp;a grand hall, or what is it that what we perceive to be a hall (as visitors when standing in one). He floated some ideas using references of halls with the MOR team to articulate this.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/qze_shw2udj3ufbovjiv9kuspnf1g8tsjplup9bioj_hmoy-pyo5zrstaq2zhlthmhmokvoamxx6-bkdyxzovdicrcgxo8jbt4igfcc2i8qggcdmtil_mxoxhccgz1da-v5_v39p.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div><figcaption>Canadian Museum of Civilizations Grand Hall - Douglas Cardinal (who takes a non-traditional or Classical approach with lots of curves)</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/h0nfqn2le5p88kpfyjgleg0pqp2p5crj-xzng6neurykf4qr6wtjywy52pdvzdh3vg68junmuvm6hlog7c5t9w8dgciq9ftfspjkmtle7eaewhdzsiyfhcgm0jpjizekgozaq5l_.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div><figcaption>Toronto Union Station Great Hall</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/r2prx9r6lyun-55kyjricpg0xqdm7t5roup7ptb0ucwrv-wjjifeodumlx19ktxuzb4kzrklfm6e0w77zlzrudwuae88qmcxd5orlx7j15l9dw86dwz-0q3vrq0uyxjj66fislgt.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div><figcaption>Great Hall of Stirling Castle</figcaption></figure><blockquote>“So I started asking myself what a grand hall is traditionally.

When groups of visitors move together in the museum, this effect is actually quite life-like and helpful for keeping pace and locating others present in the museum. Over and above that, it is also possible to find little isolated nooks if you’re looking for a bit of privacy from the chatter.&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>“So if I go behind this wall over here, then you couldn't see me and you wouldn't be able to hear me at the same volume either. One could realistically take aside a very private conversation to a different space in the museum, which was influenced by creating these nooks.”</blockquote><p>‍</p><h3>XR ARCHITECTURE BASICS<br></h3><p>When thinking about visual scope, things like the size of the lightmaps and the number of triangles are pretty much at the core of any VR architectural concept. One very interesting limitation of VR architecture (important to work around) when it comes to shapes leads architects to use a technique called&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/OcclusionCulling.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Occlusion Culling</em>.&nbsp;</a><br></p><blockquote>“Occlusion Culling means that your computer can only handle one million triangles. If a piece that has one million triangles is behind that wall, I don't have to calculate it. Which means that I can have one million triangle art pieces hidden all over the place, hidden from each other. And that way people are able to enjoy them, rather than having a museum with just one piece with a lot of triangles. So this kind of obscure problem-solution in VR and in computer graphics really drives a lot of design decisions.”<br></blockquote><p>This happens to have a kind of secret influence on the way that shapes are made and spaces are arranged. If you sometimes find that it's a little labyrinthian, that could in fact be because the design is trying to hide something from view, or from immediate discovery so as to motivate you to move. Thinking about such hiding and revealing, from different angles, creates a lot of curiosity and maybe even a lot of confusion and mystery. One thing for certain though, is that such concepts are not as true for functional architectural spaces.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h3>LIGHTING<br></h3><p>Samuel has studied architecture for nine years, both the technical side and artistic &amp; design side of it. After two years of working in architectural lighting design, he also studied for four years at Carleton University, where he had the opportunity to study the works of&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Kahn">Louis Kahn</a>&nbsp;in depth. Kahn is known to have focussed a lot on ‘indirect solar lighting’, which served as a huge inspiration for Samuel. Through VR he was able to push Kahn’s exploration beyond the limits of physicality and create light plays that were previously impossible. Creating a kind of “solar machine” which shapes the light entering the space strategically, to look good no matter the time of the day and create specific dramatic effects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/jthz3t4tnpoyconsgifu993neinbp9h3o4buebmdladqwmidpcbqcbu_kv2unf4kv8dgh5ezxxxi-kg0m5iy80711ttdsm3i7yhskpced4lzejgl_jatsxikmzzre3q683_zeddr.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/jqa_tn-hblopduwesn5jgl8wsclohecci1jicpegnighexn0jp8krzo9cetijchqwolnpfhsrr0xglgmfqva4qxcocwr4gaefatyd10dtvcm3ci1zfrnod_ktnggyuwwgon0hfy4.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><blockquote>“Even if we had a $5 million budget for a concrete building, I wouldn't be able to do 1% of what we did here.

With ideas around playing with gravity, one goal was to challenge that everything is not bound by gravity. Sometimes this play was emphasized with gravity or antigravity (floating) being positioned side by side, so they clashed. In some of the early renders, Samuel used a ray of light to demarcate where the walls were crashing into the ground. The light at the bottom of the wall gives a kind of lightness and freedom to the heaviness of a traditional wall.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1460px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1460px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/iuyxwb35h9qo1bcw5qjj0zc58v0ok1xedb1ey_ohtxqkhtxwxb5x_b7qs-tdnuao6tfgwj7hj41ugu4haptzjo0yfbyyjqklnoiuzzcos8rrjyasvpdklxlfe2taokbfejh_179w.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><blockquote>“The creases and holes in the façade of the building provided many different lighting effects inside the building based on the direction of the sun.

While there is a functional demarcation of the external wall, it starts to disintegrate as it rises and flakes away in the wind.”</blockquote><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1600px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1600px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/skgm9cnxzysti1oemostzbeh4jjto_cfwwz51vudus270wmwkzwtsg4-lhyk4w-o64fhzsxz5d0u9biaptigh8wvcojglbr4oypsdycmdsbvksik0ib-pflzuiniiaamddiuls8k.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div><figcaption>Inspired by Bruno Taut's Crystal Building and the painting of Wenzel Hablick "Freestanding Dome With Five Mountain Tops as Base"</figcaption></figure><blockquote>“It could be said that it’s an evolution of a church that was trying to free itself of gravity.

As they move deeper and float forward though, they’d experience more evidence of this explosion, in trails - reasserting that first thought of a blaze.<br></p><p>‍</p><h3>FREEING YOURSELF FROM GRAVITY<br></h3><p>As knowing much about what kind of art might make its way into the MOR next was and is never a guarantee, the design process has at no point had the luxury of knowing its dance partner. The focus, therefore, was to take as much insight into how people move, how they get lost and set in order freedoms that make losing one’s way worthwhile, as well as allowing visitors to have intimate moments with the museum itself. How light is let in plays a solid good part in creating a free feeling within closed spaces. And so every little corner casting a shadow was measured and chiseled to give autonomy to free movement.<br></p><blockquote><em>“We tend to see a lot of renders of helicopters. But we don't often fly in helicopters in real life, right?”</em><br></blockquote><p>Which is Samuel’s way of saying that like helicopters are an offhand upgrade for experiencing flying in virtual reality, even locomotion in VR doesn’t borrow from real-life movement. So one doesn’t walk, but instead, teleports in VR. In the MOR, one can float, teleport in some cases use magical wands that allow us to pseudo walk. The experience of teleportation is unique - whether that's the feeling of lightness for the body or the experience of going through a gate. In VR spatial displacement is experienced in a completely novel way.<br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:512px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="512px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/gci3vn_u2-x3-fukuwqyzkymttitgyyu59dcyscxlm4ifupi_dokn58zkvznvhjilfqr4vjzxl2gbvpd-lvbtrst8ely9h4lbgoycqux9jv5rnifw2xzu66rodqj37q1kysd4oik.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:512px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="512px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/1scbrda5wqjaq3gycu2adr-zqtmjmxyevj78ia2e41usk2zgveepvj62is0r0wbfrw8f-ryi9bga9h-wz4rzh8ab-j3srs3y8dtiphg32qjrnq2sbzdsdgmempzkqlfoi5gaelaa.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div><figcaption>A triangular gallery room that never made it to the final designs.

While working on staging one of her art pieces, the MOR teams asked her how she wanted to showcase her work.<br></p><p>The MOR tries its level-best to make technical efforts to incorporate what the artist might want, and like that innovate the space to ensure the experience isn’t compromised. The spinning portal, which will forever manage to catch your eye from any distance, came out of that collaboration.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><h3>INNOVATING SPATIAL MOVEMENT<br></h3><p>A lot of architectural innovation is possible with teleporters, teleporter shapes, and teleported mechanisms. We're used to the fact that doorways are rectangles - and that's it, that’s all, but when it comes to teleportation you can definitely go much further. It's liberating really, to think about how one can opt for these seemingly ridiculous design choices, thinking about things like - ‘Is it going to be LED? How am I going to access this for maintenance? Um, what's the lumen. I don't want any dark spots.’ is not required.</p><blockquote>“So you'll notice that at first you get these leaks of lights on the stairs, with these kinds of gradients. So it's nearly a bit like, uh, maybe a futurist art piece? And this is something that lighting designers and architects will try to do, but the way that it has been done here would have been extremely costly and maybe impossible to do in real life.”</blockquote><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1000px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1000px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/ew0rfvjfkgkzi8bvcdz9f5jmoiulxctzxobkf25q7afqjowii-76o6il-d5og8izydj8_pkdvx19yp9_ceoabvxsic8ippjdm1i8kw1zf0j5jheoislw9_qprqwadh8sf-onsb5m.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1543px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1543px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/gtykahnzmxg1noxlqrzg6h4shbamat3shf_qiylxyj12rzx6nojvnldss71kxgdx1tbvvroxhkqgdobipve9gwgoazbtsylp9v1wtxfaitlbz_hsxw-wjxdcevthquzhah9k94px.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>The space by those stairs was designed with the thought that it could be where the museum could have presentations, by artists. And if you think about someone making it to this specific location, &nbsp;even if they’re just wandering about, they can notice that there’s a presentation and decide to join the audience. And in the case that they don't wish to, this is also when other rooms make themselves apparent. So it’s meant to feel like a decision making three-way, from where you start seeing art in the distance. And the sky continues to be a good reference point as one moves, as a sort of movement marker in case you get lost.<br><br><em>“It's also a decision tree vertically, were you can decide to stay on the level and keep going straight, or go downwards into a mysterious darkness, where the sun progressively fades away. The stairs and agora space act as a circulation node, a meeting place and a landmark. As these steps are super long and roomy, they act as platforms where users can comfortably move around and it works well when they wish to teleport up or down. With smaller steps, it would have made it harder to accurately place teleporters. The other reason for the large platforms is to create different visual angles for the audience. There's also half steps so that it creates more viewing angles in case there's a huge presentation, while still making the main stairs roomy to move around. There's also a radical move in the room. The walls/roof/column collapses in the middle of the room, as if by accident. It's like a root sprouting from the found and growing upwards. There's both the idea of something fairly solid, but also quite light and free.”</em></p><p>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="padding-bottom:56.206088992974244%" data-rt-type="video" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="" data-rt-max-height="56.206088992974244%" data-rt-dimensions="854:480" data-page-url="https://youtu.be/F6hXk0z10qE"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F6hXk0z10qE"></iframe></div></figure><p>‍</p><p>Samuel used mostly Oculus Medium, for probably 90% of the design, and then for the floor and the stairs he used Revit. Oculus Medium is a VR sculpting tool - which confirms that the walls were really sculpted which in turn makes the museum a sculpture essentially. Naturally, a lot of drawings were brought in and exchanged to draw out what the museum aspired as a sculpture before being transformed into a more rationalized piece.</p><p><em>“For 3/4 of the project, it was drawings, renderings, sketching, talking, writing. The first phase is where I made: rooms, corridors, portals, general concepts. In the last month or two, I had to make a final space with a Grand Hall and three other connected rooms. This is when all the pieces came together. The last part is also the only part I started using Medium, it was the most daring risk and the MOR allowed me to make it. It could've been a complete waste of time, but it turned out to be the best risk.

The personality of the space is reflective of the processes and realities of a functional multiplayer experience for VR art. An unconventional aspect that is a good example of what might sound like a compromise above (but isn’t) is how in the MOR, the walls can become floors and floors can become ceilings - making its own kinds of rules about experiencing art by reassessing that aspect of optimization.<br></p><p>Kent Bye and Andrea Ion Cojocaru did a talk- an architectural analysis of&nbsp;<em>Half-Life Alyx.&nbsp;</em>Samuel references from the episode a little tidbit about how in the history of architecture a theoretician says something about how - ‘Not only does gravity have to carry the building, but it has to look like it can carry the building’.&nbsp;<br></p><p><em>“Here, though we had fun messing with these rules - as there's no gravity! And I am being a little bit contrarian - but what's more powerful than just being contrarian is to also take roots in gravity. And so we have this anti-gravity and additionally, things that are smashing into the ground. So, as much as there are floating pieces, there're many pieces that are very fully anchored. I feel like this interplay of opposites, middles, and transitions is more powerful than just the denying of the rules of original reality.”</em></p><p>‍</p><h3>THE ROOMS</h3><p>Before the MOR was released to the public, the rooms were polygonal, and put together in a honeybee pattern, with every room form-fitting into the other.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1600px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1600px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/pl7jaes3gzttn8afceupkiz0rnko88ajhopc65alhugc8gwzahsz3gfes0oj5kampmpcirg_ys0x6iu_hwbnv0_h5x4l7u-1yn40zpjdhhu0vbjisbfkr0tg2bvc1a8s8x5wy4d.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div><figcaption>A map of the MOR before the pre-renovation</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1600px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1600px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/zp9l3trtflallrsgnsa2ijqowo_9i-y7zuulxq9ul6rygomnm72318uuesajh7ti-ylfijybhm-5uopylmfgan7rejah6om-krbwyyp-kvozg-nkbshxehmnjfowjfc_iw8g7c3z.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div><figcaption>A look inside the opening room of MOR before the “renovated” architecture, where the concepts sculpture/models of the new building are shown along with earlier concept sketches<br></figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>The process began with figuring out rooms and then went on to designing some corridors. And once the rooms and corridors were in place, we could easily have these kinds of systematic spaces and connect them together. This is actually another instance of Occlusion Culling by separating big rooms with tight corridors so you don't see all the art at the same time.<br></p><blockquote>“There were a lot of sketches! Very much like for real world architecture, the process started with just sketching it all out. And then I would often do a lot of the concepts that were geometrical. So I started a lot of it with mathematical lines that get extruded, as smart parametric objects. It was then easy to tweak the shapes.”</blockquote><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1600px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1600px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/qthpnbsw64uxjcp4kzolxsf8t3k9z4qz-azff5un9ohjknopliyaqcrzbf-tmwashbj4fg9zbsbkylcnlik_ydysvbri0jd2ty_7wi0jq9jowsps-z5hfpnr_lapqynl1dwrozdb.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>At some point Samuel decided that they should simply brave going an extra stretch, beyond software limitations. While Revit allowed beautiful straight line based mathematics, Oculus Medium was powerful in enabling the crazy sculpture stuff that characterizes the museum. Trying to do the same using a 3D application software would be significantly more difficult. When you're in VR, you're right in there feeling it - which from a workflow standpoint makes having to imagine something such as the light, not-so-necessary. </p><p>Samuel was a part of beta-testing groups for The Wild XR (an AEC company) when they started out. They had a BFF program where he was invited to share feedback on how its design could be improved. During that time Samuel would meet Robin in VR, and together they’d look at 20 room designs in a go, discussing the experience of the concepts while being immersed in them. Seeing live sketches, even being able to sketch over them, or in the air and things like that made the collaborative process much richer than the traditional architectural methods of today - like the back and forth of PDFs, renders or videos. Instead they embodied the space together and communicated in magical ways.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1433px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1433px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/qwp2oks26vrywczuapg56wv_pt_batr0ffwrnqocxuwbhc6wsakr9iygfazzngxgv0xzlq8uyrhgwwfbva6nenhoi87qjeehj7zbqjr4wr06xsboje0uqqufupeyc8timb33hpmj.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>In the VR space, following the kind of process that the MOR followed would be considered iterative. The MOR as a client, given Robin's directorial vision, was able to perceive exactly what the feeling of the space would be like. The kind of generative feedback from the back and forth was significantly different, said Samuel, from what he works around for other projects and with other clients. </p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1600px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1600px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/mw8o3dwmtpfervllkuhg92a87n_isikoorjaxzmdvytab9uiawlcxege-kapjdwix8vwln2lwv4lkvbbx7tlfho0_slewwnfp_0rgwdylcjxxldcxj_oapo7o0atsy1p94brwb1v.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p><br></p><p>When it came to the types of corridors, Samuel didn't want to go the easy route of making a long continuous which simply opens up or leads to a final destination. The style of the MOR, as visitors know, makes use of walls to create movement in the direction of the art, with leading lines to make a viewer encounter the art in a variety of ways.</p><p>‍</p><h3>THE MAP<br></h3><p>The map was designed as a way-finder of course, but there is a lot more to note about the user experience and features, that extend from the map as a foundation stone.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><em>“It's an extremely clever, useful, and innovative feature. And certainly a key part of the museum. If you've played with the map before, you will find that it seems to get more powerful as time passes.”</em><br></blockquote><p>Over and above its app-like functions to let you choose an artist and/or teleport directly to an artwork though, it also serves as a social hub. Its round table-like structure has a fireplace-like ability to allow a nice huddle even for strangers. Everybody gathers near the map before they prepare their hike. In several instances when the MOR has hosted a show, most people have found themselves next to the map to just get talking. It has proven to be a very successful onboarding tool which also becomes a pocket-map in a way -- as if you get lost, you can teleport into the sky (by pointing right above your head) and you'll be brought right back to the map in the foyer, where you began.&nbsp;<br></p><p>This manner of using familiarity to help you find your way back is quite central to ascertaining independent navigation for each individual. In more fantastical terms, it sort of combines the<em>&nbsp;Marauder’s Map</em>&nbsp;and the function of a&nbsp;<em>Portkey</em>&nbsp;(if you know, you know) by giving you a sense of your location and that of other moving parts (or visitors) in the museum.</p><p>‍<br></p><h3>XR ARCHITECTURAL TOOLS<br></h3><p>The renders were created using Octane in 3DS Max. Samuel also used&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://enscape3d.com/">Enscape 3D</a>&nbsp;to do a lot to quick explorations of the space in 3D. Enscape3D also allowed him to send the experience to Robin, so that he could also explore on his screen or in VR and change the solar light orientation. He also used&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://thewild.com/">The Wild</a>&nbsp;to show designs in VR and remotely meet with Robin and Colin in the spaces that were being designed.<br></p><blockquote>“A lot of the early work was in Revit because it followed a logical geometry, &nbsp;but at the end I started using Medium to create that main Grand Hall in VR as a sculpture. I had to come up with a custom workflow to integrate Revit and Medium, it was quite painful!”<br></blockquote><p>In that last phase, Samuel merged the Medium and Revit model and sent it over to the MOR team. <em>“Then I did not really hear anything for like a year, and one day it was live and it was fantastic! The pace was quite different and evolved, it had gracefully matured while keeping its original soul and identity”</em>. While the MOR team made loads of changes on Sam’s finished concepts, it was all pretty much based on these discussions, sketches, and other museums that he shared. The MOR was able to learn a lot from just the way in which Samuel worked. While there are decisions taken collaboratively with a number of different architects, the heart and soul of the museum are owed to Samuel Arsenault-Brassard.<br></p>`

    content: `<p>Anand Duncan is a designer for animation in television, film, and VR. She has brought her bright playful designs to the hit series Teen Titans Go!, and her fun fashion illustrations to the pages of LA Magazine.</p><p>Her love of retro sci-fi and renaissance gowns influence both her personal and commercial work. She likes to bring appeal to her characters and clothing by highlighting the structure of the body and telling a story. In this week’s spotlight, Duncan talks about her experience using VR tools for fashion design.</p><p>‍</p><h3>FAST FACTS</h3><p><strong>Pronouns: </strong></p><p>She/her </p><p><strong>Based in: </strong></p><p>San Francisco Bay Area</p><p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong></p><p>I have appeared as a cartoon version of myself in the show Teen Titans Go</p><p>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:940px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="940px"><div><img alt="ARTIST SPOTLIGHT - Anand v2.png" src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/artist-spotlight-anand-v2.png"></div></figure><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h4><strong>Tell us a bit about yourself. What’s your background?</strong></h4><p>My background is in animation design for tv and movies. Currently I work with Warner Bros on the hit series Teen Titans Go! I've been deeply drawn to animation my entire life, growing up with classic Disney. My other love is fashion, the more avant-garde the better. I love creating appealing shapes, colors and silhouettes, and have enjoyed illustrating fashion for LA Magazine. In my personal work, my characters are always very well dressed.</p><h4><strong>How did you get into drawing and designing in VR ?</strong></h4><p>I am a big fan of the Spotlight stories by Google. My husband Brendan Duncan worked on a handful of them including Pearl, the technology was new and exciting, bringing a whole new way to experience animation. Seeing Glen Keane draw the Little Mermaid in Tilt Brush, with his genuine enthusiasm got me excited to start drawing in VR. Then Liz Edwards posted a drawing online just after Tilt Brush added the zoom ability, and I was blown away. That night I must have spend hours in Tilt Brush drawing and experimenting. There was something really fulfilling about drawing in 3D space, being able to look around the drawing from all sides, and making something that feels real. When I saw the dress form model in Tilt Brush my love for fashion got to materialize, I was hooked! Unlike when drawing fashion on paper, Tilt Brush let me stand in the dress and feel like I was actually wearing it.</p><h4><strong>What tools do you use?</strong></h4><p>For VR, I enjoy using Tilt Brush the most. The brushes feel good when drawing, it has a simple interface that doesn't get in the way, and it's just fun to use. I've played with other creative apps like Quill and Medium, but Tilt Brush is the one I always go back to.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1500px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1500px"><div><img alt="Anand Duncan’s ‘Hyper-Thread Dress’, designed in Tilt Brush, and on display in the Museum of Other Realities," src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/screenshot2019-05-27_16-56-58-2.png"></div><figcaption>Anand Duncan’s <em>Hyper-Thread Dress</em>, designed in Tilt Brush, and on display in the Museum of Other Realities,</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><h4><strong>You currently work in design for animation. Have these VR tools become a part of your professional workflow in any way?</strong></h4><p>VR has accelerated my perspective knowledge, It’s much easier to visualize 3D forms in my mind when getting ready to draw them in a 2D space for Teen Titans Go.</p><h4><strong>Could you describe your workflow?</strong></h4><p>I love creating dresses and costumes that can be worn in VR. Sometimes I'll start with an existing dress as inspiration or I'll work from more of a general idea or silhouette. Because it's in VR and not limited to reality, you can make anything you want, even if it defies gravity! </p><h4><strong>In what ways would you like to see the medium grow?</strong></h4><p>As the technology improves, I would love to see more options for the type of brushes available and ability to bring the art alive. I would love to see more “subtractive” type of brushes, where the brush strokes get darker as they overlap. You could create more textured layers, and be able to create more transparent fabric types like chiffon. I would also love to have my fashions come to life, with effects like movement and gravity.</p><p>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2216px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2216px"><div><img alt="Players in the MOR wearing dresses created by Anand Duncan" src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/mor-runway.jpeg"></div><figcaption>Players in the MOR wearing dresses created by Anand Duncan</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><h4><strong>How do you exhibit your your fashion work? Do you ever intend for your work to move from the virtual to the physical?</strong></h4><p>In addition to MOR, I show my dresses in various VR supporting platforms like Poly and SketchFab, and I also presented a VR fashion room experience at Oculus. I have not created a real world garment yet, but it would be a fun experience to work with a design house in the future.</p><h4><strong>In addition to designing with the tools, do you have any thoughts on the potential for VR/AR Fashion as a whole? &nbsp;</strong></h4><p>There are lots of possibilities of AR fashions that are exciting, like animated graphics on a piece of clothing etc. But what is special about VR fashion is you get to experience the garment in a curated environment &nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Where can we find out more about you and your work?</strong></h4><p>I post most of my work on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/FlashBunny" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@flashbunny</a>, and Instagram.</p><p>My website is <a href="http://hulabunny.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HulaBunny.com</a></p><h4><strong>Do you have any tips or advice for people looking to get into creating VR art?</strong></h4><p>Don't be afraid of the technology. It's pretty simple to get started. Just start playing with it, and have fun!</p><p>—</p><p><em>This interview is part of the MOR Artist Spotlight series, which features creators using VR as an artistic tool or medium of expression.

    content: `<p>The Fabric of Reality was a first-of-its-kind virtual reality fashion event with immersive works of fashion design. We were lucky to host some pioneers from fashion-tech and observe a newfangled ruffling of immersive narrative devices, in pursuit of virtual apparel. A <a href="">Forbes Business article</a> by Katie Baron deserves a hat-tip right here, as it noted in fine detail the wider optics of this novel, immersive fashion event. Nearly 150 attendees came to attend alongside the 100k+ who tuned in via live-stream, to collectively nudge the known image of a catwalk, along a futuristic axis.</p><p>Sam Field, Head of Creative Technology EMEA at RYOT <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/katiebaron/2020/08/04/the-fabric-of-reality-finally-an-immersive-xr-brand-experience-worth-the-hype/#3944d76e765f">summarized </a>the objective of the event as a “reimagining, not a replication” of the runway. Baron wrote about how the event dared “pushing fashion’s long-standing raison d’être as an agent for wider cultural communication and a fulcrum for trans-industry collaboration” with the three distinct virtual reality experiences shown at this event.</p><p>We got in touch with the fashion designers and their XR counterparts for a debrief, greedy to gain deeper insight about their collaborations of course. So here we are, role-calling these joint forces : <br><br>Charli Cohen (<a href="https://twitter.com/CharliCohen">@CharliCohen</a>) worked alongside animation illustrator, Ana Duncan(<a href="https://twitter.com/FlashBunny">@FlashBunny</a>), and crypto-artist, John Orion Young (<a href="https://twitter.com/JohnOrionYoung">@JohnOrionYoung</a>); a recent London College of Fashion graduate, Damara Inglês (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/damara_404_not_found/">@damara_404_not_found</a>) was paired with VR comic artist Sutu (<a href="https://twitter.com/sutu_eats_flies">@sutu_eats_flies</a>); and sustainability-centric Sabinna Rachimova (<a href="https://twitter.com/sabinna_com">@sabinna_com</a>) joined hands with VR developer and artist Vladimir Ilic (<a href="https://twitter.com/vr_human">@vr_human</a>).</p><p>‍</p><h3>ILLUSIVE AND/OR&nbsp;IMMERSIVE<br>‍</h3><p>All three works were experiences or ‘story worlds’, as the collaborators chose to refer to them. Each, an attempt at reimagining concepts that hold value for the physical body - one capable of memory, tactility, performance, fatigue and consciousness. Something Katie Baron put in writing -&nbsp; highlighting a difference in stance and a clear shift in vantage point, here - was the switch for the viewer to go from<em> </em>“voyeur to player”.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><em>“Beyond the immersive visual artistry, the most significant departure from a traditional show experience was the honing of interactive communal virtualization. It will upend the watcher vs. watched dynamic that’s always been the bedrock of the traditional catwalk spectacle, creating instead a dialogue-based landscape primed for the kind of personal engagement” </em>she notes.</blockquote><p>Fetching all of the conceptual details, from the creators of these worlds themselves, here’s what we could sum up.</p><p>‍</p><h4><strong>1. 'Embrace Your Meh with Duvet Days'</strong></h4><h5>By Charli Cohen (London), Ana Duncan (Seattle) &amp; John Orion Young (Oregon)<br>‍</h5><p>The multiple elements and story world for this piece attempt to explore the inner struggle of someone with mental health concerns. &nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=gbKiidntSBU">Anxious Alien</a> by Hana was chosen by the artists to accompany the work.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1600px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1600px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/qjohfniofz00dskj1ybrocjwq9gpvfczq9jnodd0caxdhx1bhfltjbxxd_mywx-1abl0qddelm38iyl_1edr-1ujq04x7ne4v802lfyj9k0fwkohts_r_edkwjcg7a_s3qwl7hqk.png"></div></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Charli Cohen shared how she and her collaborators wanted to understand the farther end of high functioning depression. “I was really excited to understand what is possible within this space - it is very much outside the realm of anything I’ve done before.” The Gudetama ‘lazy egg’ character of Japanese brand Sanrio draws in visitors to an inner-chamber of sorts, where a DJ hosts an audience. This concert setup even includes a back-stage with racks of clothes from Cohen’s collection. A more extroverted version, perhaps - of the same character- stands guarding this inner world with an ‘Upcycled Why Coat’ on. Visitors can click in and wear this coat for an altered view of the garment.</p><p>Ana Duncan added how the key concept here was “showing a side of energy, and a side of lethargy”. The VR garment design was created to feel wearable but in a fantasy setting where an anime goddess is surrounded with the lounging gudetama.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1600px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1600px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/6jbuujlj8u7zludrj3ozzwx_tkswss7zpjny_eft8jqyapg9syz1ah9t5n1vvvnyb6stiqdhig7cxl4qqzhhhzvniqzhddqfgv1sshnfsl3zdocwtyddu2hdr1iij9cjkrup7tye.png"></div></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1281px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1281px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/wd4_x97iwdaaclft9senu40k2gpyinmjg4ajo6ykol-b7bfn8tn4z9k7nn3oifcz0qy-mocved6sq4ncebhlofiapmymyif1jnc3iznxfwnocvkrinrqtvbduolvb6nxum0ore1s.jpeg"></div><figcaption>CHARLI&nbsp;COHEN'S 'ISOLATE&nbsp;MEH hoodie' from her web store</figcaption></figure><p><br>“For me fashion is a medium for telling important stories. And in VR, the translations of these stories can be pretty much limitless,”<em> </em>says Cohen. The gudetama has been featured in Cohen’s prior work as well and we were able to see some character sketches shared between the collaborators that observe the lazy side (or ‘gude gude’) of the tama (from tamago - egg in Japanese) in an <br>egg-sistential crisis, if you will.</p><p>We also spoke to John Orion Young, who measured these mood swings in careful strides, as “the closer you get to gudetama, the deeper you go into his feelings”. The frenzied concept of having “a party in a frying pan and going inside gudetama’s head” was what made the collaboration a joy for Young. The audience in the story world hypes up the gudetama with all their adulations and celebrity worship, while the gudetama is chained in an eggshell. Several motifs here bring up the artistic struggle that the persona must endure for the sake of the show and the patrons.</p><p>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="padding-bottom:75%" data-rt-type="video" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="" data-rt-max-height="75%" data-rt-dimensions="640:480" data-page-url="https://youtu.be/lwFs4gT4HrU"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lwFs4gT4HrU"></iframe></div></figure><p>‍</p><h4><strong>2. 'Symbiotic_Wear'</strong></h4><h5>By<strong> </strong>Damara Inglês (London) &amp; Sutu (Australia)<br>‍</h5><p>The jelly-like portal with all its visceral, fleshy elements took turns and dimensions, as if to hold space for a powerful striding goddess. The narrative here was created with moving parts and swirling liquids that were as much an ode to the elements as to contemporary tricks of light and depth. The sound design was a combination of a voiceover by Inglês’ with production by Tobacco Rat. Another track can be heard if one floats closer to the outer membrane of this bubble - designed by Em Halberstadt from A Shell in a Pit.</p><blockquote><em>“Symbiotic_Wear derives from the idea of symbiosis - the interaction between two organisms. The virtual fashion in this sense becomes an extension of the user’s virtual identity to allow them to better interface with their new virtual environment, an environment that does not comply with the laws of physics in our physical world reality. In our environment there is weightlessness and an ability to fly and interact with the virtual world. Our model on her virtual catwalk demonstrates how her holographic floral extensions move weightlessly with her and stretch out to interact with the greater environment.”</em></blockquote><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1600px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1600px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/sstqzxzytcltsg2ouuzbym9s-aiptxyufb7idhezk7ty51jkxnc9vbl6cbdkihvonzng4byzac9nzalq6cnqcsxifjcpl1vwe4wlvhu4sx-jt-cplh_fyjoecquprd1vswwms28.png"></div></figure><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1600px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1600px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/gpu5o_yom5emng47mtvqbqnljkwerjs1pgy5dp5zcnibvl88ehrw_cg4bzligpgy5ffitjbuaveieqvosqfpre7zkmzgjmjnaeaawrgkvkmg37rnlemesg1i2weii-xx6847s9a9.png"></div></figure><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1600px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1600px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/fbjwt9gixgqmsx3pqppc3zhyu5jat1tpjjbom19pcqojrcac7iphm314tixbod_anpvbpbfph9sxoimxl7y8b9ki7yl5irxldykkv5ms9dtfo3o6vwo4wwoktoqy8athj5pftqch.png"></div><figcaption>'symbiotic wear' from the fabric of reality exhibit at the museum of other realities</figcaption></figure><blockquote><em>“Damara happens to have a great vision for the future of fashion, and also that of the relationship between the physical and virtual body. Damara entered the project with an ethos and a mood board that communicated very clearly the direction that she’d want to take and this direction was very much in sync with my thoughts about virtual identities. We both understood that these two areas of virtual identities and virtual fashion are interrelated - as forms of personal expression.”</em></blockquote><p>Sutu reported how he sourced the Unity project files with Damara and taught her how to use the collaborative features so that they could iterate on their initial designs. The time zone difference worked in their favour, as one would work a shift and push updates and then the other would receive them, see the progress, bounce off ideas and then add their own. "I would then respond to Damara's new additions and continue. This feedback loop was healthy and full of surprises that kept us both motivated to push our collective artwork to another level” reported the fairly satisfied artist.</p><p>In an Instagram post by Tobacco Rat, Inglês describes the installation using the notion that “we are cavemen of the virtual age - the very explorers of a virtual era that is yet to fully unfold”. As such the dynamic experience hopes to question “the potentials of the interactions between fashion and post-human bodies, cyborg inter-beings that explore the elasticity and fluidity of persona”. The collaborating artists were inspired by the deep ocean creatures that they imagine floating in space like a surreal galaxy of connected beings -- a metaphor for portals entering parallel realities. The piece is also interested in approaching the notions of digital privacy, activism and fashion sustainability.</p><p>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="padding-bottom:56.206088992974244%" data-rt-type="video" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="" data-rt-max-height="56.206088992974244%" data-rt-dimensions="854:480" data-page-url="https://youtu.be/SXX5MqLWed0"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SXX5MqLWed0"></iframe></div></figure><p>‍</p><h4><strong>3. 'A Stitch in Time'</strong></h4><h6>By Sabinna Rachimova (London) &amp; Vladimir Ilic (Germany)<br>‍<em><br><br></em>“Rachimova and Ilic’s world was a sanctuary in homage to nature, via a palette cleansing virtual tunnel of lights before a calming space” wrote Baron. In a note from the designer, we found a description of an ‘Eternity Coat’ - one capturing time and space in its weave - with multiple layers, different perspectives and some blank and transparent parts or mirrors that reflect back the viewer’s image and include them in the memory being stitched.</h6><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2480px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2480px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/sabinna_vlad_final-sculpture.jpg"></div></figure><p>The collaboration conceived a story world situated in the 'outside', such that a garment is not being entered, but an inference of existence is being extended. &nbsp;Exploring the meaning of space and time, of moving around in nature through a stitched and handcrafted garment that etches the memory first, before being created in VR. The visual references came from some works of embroidery from Rachimova’s family archive - some pieces embroidered by her grandmother along with some crochet and knitting work from one of Rachimova’s first pieces. And overlaying recorded voice-overs in her mother’s and her own voice (spoken in Tatar and Russian) to make a connection to the past, in all sincerity. The installed work allows some elements of interaction too, like one could attach floating flowers to their avatar. This is a manner by which the viewer gets to “become part of our memories. You will also see crystals in our story world - they represent a way of looking into the future as well as seeing your own reflection from the past” said Rachimova.</p><p>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1600px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1600px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/8emtwlmdams14w8qoymhljdymo4-moydrqmk1bms6hbym8mnm15bom_hiyaikyoxbii0s2iswtmmmechxomsiigmiirymcx5ushqgzmohyj0la0hwqv14jemwthha1xrj4bthd5x.png"></div></figure><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1600px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1600px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/qw20vwbmctkcab09uh6fy6zgc0p4anhz1hks6qzoh4e_snea4cirwkb9mqx8rbaxlbmi2wdoebv8hd4sh-sitpc0qusjvquqhidpqacml8qkur6rmpro5vnh13l6bftg_dds8ojp.jpeg"></div></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sabinna found the whole experience to be beyond incredible. Her collaboration with Ilic opened a whole new world to us and it was amazing to see how a process that began in sketches on paper evolved into a VR world.</p><blockquote><em>“Vlad is a real visionary and I had a lot of fun designing for a virtual space. Vlad and I have similar backgrounds and both wanted to explore our roots and traditional handcraft from the places we are originally from. Also, we both felt strong about the sound aspects of our story world. It definitely helped to be on the same page and combine both visions during this exciting collaboration”, </em>she expressed.</blockquote><p>‍</p><h3>BODY POSITIVE</h3><p><br><em></em>The ability to feel ‘present’ near these garments in all their appeal is a “game-changer”, said Moin Roberts-Islam (Technology Development Manager at FIA). “It’s a very visceral and powerful method of communicating with an audience.”&nbsp;</p><p>In her Forbes article, Baron recognized a core subtlety of the show that can be captured where the ‘self’ meets the ‘synthetic’. She perceived the show as a mastery of “the ‘human tech interlace’ – a cohesive blend of the self and the synthetic to elicit a more compelling, intimate and personal brand experience”. Needless to say, she indulged in all of MoRs social affordances - the avatar generated shadows, the sound design emulating small huddles and the parting of ways; floating to seek “connection amid the decreed anonymity”. Such submergence made the live event feel like a near-real brush with bodies, and perhaps with fabric in a new media fabrication. </p><p>So, here's to a virtual all-season fashion collection. The <a href="/#download">experiences shall remain in the MOR </a>for the next twelve months for the perusal of visitors - with several embodied tangibilities as new realities for us to don.</p><p>‍</p>`

    content: `<p>Durk van der Meer hails from Groningen, Netherlands. A painter and digital artist, he graduated from Academie Minerva, Hanze University with rigorous and traditional training in visual art. As a self-taught 3D artist, he has a striking body of work and a wealth of experiential loot from his time and toil in architectural visualisation and the animation industry. Some early work includes projects with&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://happyship.com/">Happy Ship</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>-- a company in Groningen - where he assisted on&nbsp;Polska Warrior, an animation project that received a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Calf_(award)">Golden Calf</a>. For the last seven years, he has been an independent freelancer, bringing game engines such as Unreal Engine and Unity Engine into his workflow. When we asked Durk about his finding his way into VR, he made it out to be as simple as buying his first VR headset,&nbsp;the Oculus DK1.</p><p><br></p><blockquote><em>“I had this scene set up, of a house... kind of like a demo project. And I was able to walk through it in VR! It was the first version and so the resolution was not very good and my video card couldn’t really handle it. But still, the sense of being there, and having an accurate sense of scale - it was a real treat as a first experience”</em>.<em>&nbsp;</em></blockquote><p><br></p><p>We asked Durk about what he thinks might still be traditional skills or prerequisites for creators of 3D art as more and more of them make the transition to VR tools. He felt that more than skills, it’s the manner in which tools are being wielded that is challenging tradition - “The manner in which VR tools are being employed to create art in 3D for sure has taken a non-traditional turn.&nbsp;Like when you see the Quill sculpts or [work made in] Tilt Brush, they don’t have UVs and they don’t have standard materials. In Quill, you have to paint your own lighting. And that is what is so cool about it. It gives you the challenge to lend what you create in VR its own personality.”&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;</em></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1920px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1920px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/terrarium-smaller.png"></div><figcaption><a href="/artwork/terrarium"><em>Terrarium </em></a>(2019)<em> </em>by <a href="/artists/durk-van-der-meer">Durk van der Meer</a></figcaption></figure><p><br></p><p>While creating the Terrarium, a work made for the MoR, Durk wanted the piece to not just draw people into the space as an artwork but become a place to hang out in. In many ways, Durk’s professional background in level design is what shimmers in the Terrarium as he really makes&nbsp;<em>room</em>&nbsp;for his viewers. In a stylized but traditional sense, the Terrarium is expecting guests. An asymmetric dome from the outside, with quarters separated by walls, walls adorned with art and technological gadgets and media - it wants to wow you. It wants to somewhat belong to the real (estate) world. The plants, the furniture, the coziness - as mere details they may challenge notions of functionality and space, but they are nevertheless contained in known notions and are situated in a realistic sensibility. There are signs of everyday life in the Terrarium, even if in the lack of a homeowner or a host. The place is tidied up, well-pruned and made hospitable.&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote><em>“I cannot really explain why, but I always had this fascination for terrariums. It is the same fascination you have when you are peering into a dollhouse. You want to see yourself in it. You kind of project yourself into the space. And of course the cool thing with this piece came with the fact that the MoR has the capability to allow teleporting and re-scaling”.</em><br></blockquote><p>The scale of the surroundings in the MoR and other people as they explore the Terrarium from the inside and the outside is able to privilege a sense of relational space. At the opening event, there was an illustrious moment when five tiny visitors were just having a conversation inside the work. And there was a big guy on the outside, sort of like the rare friendly giant we know from the movies - just bending down and looking into the terrarium. That perspective, even just watching this giant peering in - it was kind of cinematic in just the way that Durk intended it to be.</p><p>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="padding-bottom:56.206088992974244%" data-rt-type="video" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-height="56.206088992974244%" data-rt-dimensions="854:480" data-page-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_K28Qb5Jsw"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u_K28Qb5Jsw"></iframe></div></figure><p><br></p><p>Terrarium was made with Google Blocks which Durk likes to call it the&nbsp;“MS Paint of VR modelling&nbsp;-&nbsp;a simple but intuitive tool with a basic set of options, Google Blocks really lets the maker focus on building”. Modelling it using Google Blocks allowed for the irregular shapes that characterize it, modelling which isn’t as easy or fun in actual 3D software. The processing, although, did happen using 3DS Max.&nbsp;“I could see then if there were some issues with the geometry. Usually, it is pretty clean, because when you come from Blocks you do not have to worry about flip normals or anything like that”. Then he had to unwrap the UVs and take it into Substance Painter where the materiality was brought in. The combination of low-poly 3D art in Google Blocks and the touches with Substance Painter have really opened up a style that Durk shows an appetite for.</p><p><br></p><blockquote><em>“A lot of traditional art does end up in VR though. And that is just true for art and games. As people have a skill set built before the new technology comes. And then they import as much of the skill into the new technology. But of course, the truly exciting stuff in VR is stuff you couldn’t use or even have thought of before. Stuff that is not possible without VR.”</em></blockquote><p><br></p><p>An interesting discussion came up in our interview with Durk, about prototopia. He spoke about how images that we create through movies, comics and literature most often suggest a dystopian future and unfortunately that’s what abysmally sticks around.<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>“I realized that there are very few science fiction movies presenting a world that I’d want to live in. And I do not think that these worlds are just for entertainment as they do get stuck in our heads”.<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>They reflect a kind of dread in their foresight. And so we rely on these images from a futuristic perspective, and we need somewhere technology can still coexist with nature, without harming the planet. One where technology and the planet are not at odds with each other.”<br></p><p>To create worlds that are just beautiful - let’s not rush to think of it as too optimistically wishful or oblivious. Visual artists and storytellers could heed this suggestion - as a world without a grave idea to ground itself could exist to make a larger point about sustainability. Durk explains what he means through his love for architecture. Having lived in Holland, Durk embraces the 70s minimalism prevalent in the architecture there, appreciating it for its sustainability.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>“If you go through the city and you look at these buildings and ask yourself - Which buildings might still be here 300 years from now? - the answer might be, the oldest ones. The ones that are already 300 years old”. And he adds how that isn’t because of how these buildings have stood the test of time but because of the fact that we have found reasons to cherish them through meaning-making. We have read into these images deeply and owned them through cultural deliberation. Why aren’t we creating buildings (and images) then that we hope to keep around for another 500 years? Despite the evidence, we have that proves this to be technically possible? Durk hopes to bring forth this manner of thinking into his future projects as well.</p><p><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="padding-bottom:56.206088992974244%" data-rt-type="video" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-height="56.206088992974244%" data-rt-dimensions="854:480" data-page-url="https://youtu.be/lvFvjbPL_GI"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lvFvjbPL_GI"></iframe></div></figure><p>‍</p><p><a href="https://www.durkatwork.com/maranga"><em>Maranga</em></a>&nbsp;- a virtual world he has been building for about two years is a VR park that features in the living room of the Terrarium.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>It is a project which he hopes to turn into a multiplayer social VR experience.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>‍</p><p>‍</p><blockquote>“Most of the VR things that I have made end up in Maranga. And it’s also in the same style as the Terrarium- using Google Blocks and Substance Painter workflow. I guess it is a little bit more fantastical. I’m really excited about releasing that soon”.</blockquote><p><br></p><p>While Durk retains his love for 2D art, he did confide in us how good it feels to escape the boundaries of the two-dimensional image. This shift is nearly as significant as the collapse of the ‘fourth wall’ for cameras, if you will. With Durk’s interest in space, sociability, and sustenance we think of him as a storyteller toying with what a story can be, if told spatially. Immersed engagement has largely relied on story structures before, but now embodied immersion in virtual reality is altering the promise of a story - with an unprompted, non-traditional structure. With shifts in the nature of content out there for the digitally savvy viewer to engage with, one new outcome has certainly been how the performance of the process of making VR artwork has become the artwork, in part. Like film viewers learned how to feel physically embodied through the moving camera, VR environments, games and experiences are going the full stretch to bring the makers perspective closer to the viewer's perspective.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>Learn more about Durk on his <a href="https://www.durkatwork.com/home">website.</a></p><p>—</p><p><em>The MOR Artist Spotlight series features creators using VR as an artistic tool or medium of expression.

What’s your background?</strong></h4><p>My background started when I was quite young, I was always making art. And I used to draw a lot. I would make a lot of home videos with our family camera. And that kind of led me to University to study in a programme called New Media. There, they taught a lot of installation art and a lot of physical.. and there was coding - which I did not like - and so I just kind of made everything into a visual and sound installation. And that kind of led me to sound. Then I came to Vancouver and have started working with ‘A Shell in the Pit’ for a few years now. And I guess I got into VR through that, with Gord who is working on Colin and Sarah Northway’s ‘Fantastic Contraption’. &nbsp;I don’t do a lot of art in VR, but I did for this. Mostly, I just do sound design for indie games. I’ve done sound on ‘Night in the Woods’ and ‘Wander Song’, ‘Ikenfell’, ‘Untitled Goose Game’ - and yes I work on Fantastic Contraption too.</p><h4><strong>How did you get into VR - was it a deliberate decision or was it happenstance?</strong></h4><p>Let’s see. Getting into VR for me was both deliberate and a happenstance thing for me, I think. In my program it was New Media. So they were teaching a lot along the same lines as VR, but they did not mention VR too much. It was a few years ago, I was always really interested in immersive art, so it kind of made sense to go into this direction. The piece that I made for the MoR - I actually made previously and in my thesis I kind of made a physical version of the ‘Memory Machine’ - just kind of made a big box that you could stand in and then I projected video onto all the walls. So it was kind of like a physical version of what is there in the MoR now. I guess that helped me prepare for it - especially with sound. Just thinking through the immersiveness of it. </p><h4><strong>Your installation <em>Capsule </em>is on display in the MOR, what went into creating the piece?</strong></h4><p>I feel like throughout the time that I have been creating I have always had the same idea coming back to me - which is the idea of taking our memories and capturing them, on a machine, which we do on our phones all the time - but I wanted to explore the idea of having that in a museum. So I created this box that you would walk into - and I got one of those mirrors that you see on the top of, or inside of stores, like a spherical, half sphere mirror. I attached that to the end of the box and I projected into it, so it was kind of like a fish-eye type effect. And I had a 10 minute video playing on a loop - of just this person’s memories. It had been someone who worked on the machine, and they kind of degrade over time. So that was the first version. </p><p>What I put into the MOR - I created that in <a href="/tool/tilt-brush">Tilt Brush</a>. It was a similar kind of circular/spherical design, but there’s no visuals. It’s all done with audio. So you stick your head in and you will hear these recordings that I recorded with binaural microphones - which is a type of microphone that records how you hear as a human. With a normal microphone what gets recorded in not how we hear - as we have two ears and our head affects the frequency of the sound that we hear. So binaurals are microphones are basically that you put in your ears. Ever since I got them I have been recording random snippets of my life, things that I thought were interesting without really having a purpose. And I thought that this installation would be a really good time to use them. So, if you put your head into the sphere, you will hear..and feel sounds as if you’re in that space… because of the nature of the recordings.</p><p>In the center, there is a voice - which is me - and it’s like someone talking about how the memories are fading away and the idea of the intangibility of memories. How, as humans, we put too much effort into trying to capture them instead of just living.</p><h4><strong>Could you recall your first VR experience and your reaction to it?</strong></h4><p>My first VR experience was, I think, with ‘Fantastic Contraption’. It was quite an impact to feel the sense of being in another world and kind of understand all the possibilities that could bring you, and how immersed you get in the world. It took me some time before I could be in VR for a longer period of time, I would get kind of motion sick. But that is definitely better now. &nbsp;</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1351px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1351px"><div><img alt="Visitors viewing a spatial interview with Halberstad, beside her installation,  Capsule  (2017)" src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/em-interview-group-v2-cropped-adjusted.png"></div><figcaption>Visitors viewing a spatial interview with Halberstad, beside her installation, <a href="/artwork/capsule"><em>Capsule</em></a><em> </em>(2017)</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><h4><strong>Is there a VR art piece with sound that has left a lasting impression?</strong></h4><p>Yeah I think it being the first one that I tried - and I spent a lot of time in Fantastic Contraption - listening. It was my boss - Gord McGladdery who did the sound. So that was my first experience of what sound could do in VR. In that game, it’s really musical and other worldly. So yeah, I think that would be the one with the most impact. <br> &nbsp;</p><h4><strong>What tools do you use?</strong></h4><p>To edit, I use a program called Reaper. And I think it’s a really great tool as it’s open source and very flexible.</p><p>For the most part, when I’m working, I do a lot of recording. I don’t actually use a lot of tools in the digital sense - I don’t use a lot of plug-ins. The first thing I usually think about is - can I record this? And I’ll go out and walk around my house and see what objects can make an interesting sound. I would go outside and make noises with my voice, into the microphone. I think it allows me to be more creative in a sense, because I’m making my own source material as opposed to just finding stuff in a library, or using synthesis. Which I think is also great for a lot of reasons but this is kind of the way that I get the most enjoyment out of doing sound design. I used to have a little sound fort, which was like sound panels that were stacked up - and I would go in and it would make the room quieter. </p><p>Now I have just a microphone on my desk and I like that. It’s a lot easier to just grab it whenever and there’s less of a barrier between setting up a microphone in a different area, and I can just kind of go for it. So there are a lot more reflections a lot of the time, but I can still move it around if I need to. So I guess the most important tool that I have is the microphone. And with that there are very few limitations. </p><p>Unless there is a situation that I need a sound like that of a European bird or something. In which case I would have to use a library! I think most of my sound design I can do with a microphone.<br></p><h4><strong>Found objects and found sounds are tools for you. Would you like to speak to that?</strong></h4><p>A lot of the work I do is with found objects. So instead of trying to think about it rationally - that what could I use to make this sound? - I like to take inspiration from what’s around me. So going on walks, seeing what I can do with my voice is usually really helpful.</p><h4><strong>What do you think is changing about sound design because of changing sound equipment?</strong></h4><p>I think that generally the trajectory of most technology is that it is getting less clunky and more accessible - which is really great. I think there used to be a lot of pressure to have the best equipment, kind of in any medium. But sound design as well.</p><p>Now you can kind of get a low to mid end recorder, and you don’t have to worry about quality as everything is getting better. I often tell sound designers that are starting out and wondering what equipment they should get - what microphones… I tell them that it is more important to just record a lot and practice, and not really worry about having the best equipment.</p><p>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:600px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="600px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/em-interview-roundtable-small-reduced.gif"></div><figcaption>Activating a Spatial Interview with Em Halberstadt beside <a href="/artwork/capsule"><em>Capsule </em></a><em>(2017)</em></figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><h4><strong>Explain your creative process? What did you recently give sound to - something you’re proud of?</strong></h4><p>My creative process usually starts with looking around in my environment and seeing what I can use. Recently I was making the ‘teleport’ sounds for the MoR, and I knew that I was gonna use stone. So I did spend some time listening to sounds in the library to see what would work. But then I knew that I wanted some really clean sounds [that were also] kind of, almost musical. So I went onto my patio and I got a big rock and a microphone. And I recorded a few impacts of rock on brick. I find that doing that - it does take a lot of work to go outside and set things up to do the actual recording - but it saves a lot of time in the long run. I don’t have to look through a lot of sounds and I have a limited palette that I can work with. And that makes me do interesting things with it, when I limit myself. </p><h4><strong>Any surprising lessons? Do things always translate?</strong></h4><p>I guess the process can be surprising if I go through a bunch of source materials and there’s a sound that I wasn’t expecting to use, but it just sounds right. Lots of times when you’re designing sound, you think of the object as the sound. Instead of just turning that part off and just listening to what the emotion the sound gives you. Or how… something I often think about when I work is how ‘pleasant’ does it sound. </p><p>If I am recording a door, and putting the sound of a door - in some where, I could have the door recorded and think okay that’s a door, it should work. But then it doesn’t actually sound like a door. Maybe there’s a scratchy, high end frequency that is uncomfortable to listen to. So yeah, listening as if you don’t know what it is can yield some pretty cool results. It’s kind of the same as when you’re drawing and you wanna draw a door (laughs) rather than just drawing what you know, you draw what you see. <br> </p><h4><strong>Do you have other similar examples?</strong></h4><p>Well I guess, one of the examples of an object where it’s… the sound of something that isn’t what it is, is... I think when I started out, I researched a lot of these - looking into what other people use. And one of them is - I think it’s baking soda or flour for snow. It happens a lot, it’s often not the actual thing you see. </p><p>Especially with stuff that doesn’t exist. Like with creature sound design people often use a pig screeching - that is a very common one. And camels sound like monsters.</p><h4><strong>What’s your favourite sound for a monster?</strong></h4><p>With sound design, you combine layers. So if I’m doing a monster or a creature I’ll often just do it myself, first. And often, if you slow down a human sound, it can sound like a monster. And then layering different animals, also slowed down animals, on top of that usually works. A camel I think is my favourite. Weird sounding animal. A camel and I think seals. Yes.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="padding-bottom:56.25%" data-rt-type="video" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-height="56.25%" data-rt-dimensions="0:0"><div><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aBo6Hq6tFvI?wmode=opaque&enablejsapi=1" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></figure><p>SFX reel for Vancouver-based <a href="https://www.ashellinthepit.com/"><em>A Shell in the Pit</em></a>, where Halberstadt works on audio</p><p>‍</p><h4><strong>What in your professional work do you think of as ‘traditional’ - and would you say that designing sound for VR is similar to that experience or is it starting to become non-traditional?</strong></h4><p>I mean I guess traditionally game audio has been pretty—people have used a lot of synthesis and it has been abstract. But in VR, a lot of it has to be pretty real sounding as people kind of expect to be in that environment. And, for instance, there’s usually a lot of physical objects that you can throw around and that has to sound realistic. If you throw it really hard against the wall, it has to make a bigger impact and then when it hits the ground, it will sound quieter… those exist in normal games as well. But it has to be a higher level of detail in VR. Same with the environment sounds - like the ambience. For it to be immersive it has to be all around you. So, traditionally you would just make a stereo ambience - which is left and right with speakers. And VR has what we call a quad ambience, which is all around you… a point in your front and behind you, which calls for a lot more detail. </p><p>Same with putting sounds on any object you can think of in a space. There’s a world that I did ambience for recently in the MoR that has many different… there were pipes. So you put the sound of hissing pipe on it, and when you get closer, you hear it louder… kind of thing. I think it also encourages people to explore more around them, instead of just standing and looking at things. If they hear a shift in their environment, they’d be more likely to explore.</p><h4><strong>Share your thoughts on meditative sound and conscious listening - or shall we call it sound for mindfulness?</strong></h4><p>I think part of what drew me towards being a sound designer was that the idea of promoting listening. I think that it’s often the case that people don’t really pay attention to the sounds around them. And I think that’s a little dangerous because even if you’re not paying attention, these sounds do affect you. So if you’re constantly immersed in the city you hear all this construction and all these cars. It’s gonna subconsciously stress you out. And you might not really know why, you might just think it’s something else. But if you… a lot of people, when I talk about this, kind of get mad at me (laughs). That, because of… once you start listening - it just grows exponentially. And you’ll begin to really notice things, making it tough to turn some things off. But I think that the benefits outweigh that as you learn that if sound is stressing you out, you will give yourself more opportunities for silence. And you’d even appreciate silence. By going into the forest, or by just listening to the more soothing and natural sounds. So I think that using sound for meditation is a really good way to solve for - if you find it hard to meditate. I don’t do the super conscious meditation myself, but I often will just sit and listen. And it’s kind of a different form of it for me. If you are sitting and listening to the sounds around you in a forest or something as things are happening - it really situates you in that moment. As, to pay attention to a sound means that you have to be listening at the same time that the sound is happening.</p><h4><strong>Are there any current projects that you wish to share?</strong></h4><p>So, currently I am working on a few different indie games. I am soon to release a game called <em>Untitled Goose</em> <em>Game</em>. And that is a game where you play as a goose and then just go around bothering people. I’m also working on another game about creativity and painting or drawing called <em>Chicory. </em>And another game about a school of magic called <em>Ikenfell</em>. So we (<em>A Shell in the Pit</em>) is actually a team of 6 people and we work on projects together and also have our own. So I am working on a few projects with the team.</p><h4><strong>Any tips for sound artists working with VR?</strong></h4><p>If you’re a VR artist and you wanna use sound or experiment with sound more, I think that the best thing to do would be to get a little recorder. You don’t even need to get a nice microphone to go with it. Just a cheap one should do. Just start recording anything you can think of and then you can make yourself a little library to work with. Specifically if you’re making something that you want sound for - you could try just using that recorder and record your voice. There are a few games that use voice for all the sound effects. So there’s certainly a lot you can do with your voice. If you’re just starting out, play around with a program called Audacity. And Reaper - the program I use - it kind of seems like it might be complicated. But if you put in a few hours into learning it, and if you know editing software already- like video editing software, then it is quite similar to that. </p><p>If you’re recording without knowing too much about it, I guess I would say - always use headphones. Yeah, just make sure you’re listening to what you’re recording. </p><p><br></p><p>—</p><p><em>This interview is part of the MOR Artist Spotlight series, which features creators using VR as an artistic tool or medium of expression.

Intent on subverting conventional approaches to VR, Davies and her team developed the use of semi-transparency in real-time, and invented a user interface based on breathing and balance that enabled immersants to seemingly "float" among translucent landscapes. <a href="http://www.immersence.com/osmose/index.php"><em>Osmose</em></a> and its companion work <a href="http://www.immersence.com/ephemere/index.php"><em>Ephémère</em></a> (1998) became world-renowned for their aesthetic sensibility, technical innovation and emotional effect on participants.</p><p>These works have been widely exhibited, including at San Francisco's Museum of Modern Art; Barbican Art Centre, London; Australian Center for the Moving Image, Melbourne; Museum of Monterrey, Mexico; Montreal Musée d'Art Contemporain; the National Gallery of Canada; and Laboral, Spain. They have received extensive media coverage, ranging from Art in America to Wired and New Scientist, and continue to be the subject of academic studies. The first monograph on her work, <em>Char Davies' Immersive Virtual Art and the Essence of Spatiality</em> (by Laurie McRobert) was published by University of Toronto Press in 2007. Both <a href="http://www.immersence.com/osmose/index.php"><em>Osmose</em></a> and <a href="http://www.immersence.com/ephemere/index.php"><em>Ephémère</em></a> were recently re-mastered to run on contemporary technology.</p><p>[Excerpted from <a href="http://www.immersence.com/">Char Davies'</a> website]</p><p>‍</p><h4>MEET THE GUEST SPEAKERS</h4><p><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width=""><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/qxyaawf1raeepelfaguyd85ksme5s0nerkkqkek9laqiexi1ga14omddi2mpyntrbez-rxfrbyemcdimgaarwooi2zeki1mpft31d9okqsixuxp3_m0bnh7toafcgfvefxctjiiv.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p><br></p><h4>About Glen Fraser</h4><p>Glen Fraser builds software for the interactive and immersive arts.

He developed some of the earliest VR art installations, including over a dozen works produced at the Banff Centre for the Arts from 1991-94. From there, he focused on creating VR installations for Char Davies in Montreal, Canada, developing <em>Osmose (1995)</em> and <em>Éphémère (1998)</em>, which subsequently toured worldwide. After stints as a developer for Softimage|XSI and as a computer vision PhD student at McGill University, he has returned to the art world, and is now working at Immersence to develop innovative tools for the creation of new artworks.</p><p><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width=""><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/o2keb-3yybwfjcbxhm-ufm_hawzdfvn5ywnpft82ajltfny3utaxmrzojl-6xitbdfqareo_zntasmckqrtcatrc-kz6mti_jq8l85vozrckdpfvz4avaamopl-vdm7t_yujqkwa.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p><br></p><h4>About Jacki Morie</h4><p>Dr. Jacquelyn Ford Morie is known for her use of Virtual Reality (VR) to deliver meaningful experiences that enrich people’s lives.

She recently built a virtual world ecosystem for NASA called ANSIBLE, designed to provide psychological benefits for future astronauts who will undertake extremely long isolated missions to Mars. Dr. Morie is currently working on a new version of her patented scent device to bring more emotional power to VR.<br></p><p>A little more about this restoration project offered up from Glen Fraser’s blog, in his own words -<br></p><blockquote>“<a href="http://www.immersence.com/"><em>Immersence</em></a> is Char’s research company, which was founded in 1998 to continue the work she’d started at Softimage. Shortly after its founding, I believe Immersence purchased the <em>last four</em> dVisor headsets produced, just before Division went out of the HMD business entirely. This turned out to be a smart move; a couple of those headsets continue to function – sort of – though neither of them does so gladly. And until the <a href="https://www.vive.com/">Vive</a> and <a href="https://www3.oculus.com/en-us/rift/">Rift</a> headsets came along this year, the pickings were slim for a good replacement headset.”<br></blockquote><p><br></p><p>Hear the full story by joining us on Thursday morning.

    content: `<p>With our <a href="/blog/fall-2019-update-ghosts-ghouls">Fall Update</a>, we introduced a new way to learn more about the amazing artists pushing the envelope of virtual reality (VR) art. Spatial Interviews are similar to audio tours or podcasts, except in the MOR, these are captured moments you can walk around in and experience like you were there. In addition to a guided tour of Sean Tann's <em>Complex Chaos,</em> we now have two new Spatial Interviews in the MOR, one with VR artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/johnorionyoung/">John Orion Young</a> and the other with sound designer, <a href="http://www.emaudible.com/">Em Halberstadt</a>.</p><p>‍</p><p><em>Complex Chaos (2018)</em> by Sean Tann</p><p>A major consideration when designing new features for the MOR is making sure we lean towards the strengths of the medium. For the past few months, we've been exploring potential ways to provide more of a background to the pieces we feature in the museum. Since reading text in VR isn't nearly as fun as it sounds, we felt it would be interesting to integrate or even build upon the information on the museum labels by tying them more into the spatial experience.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:3150px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="3150px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/interview-v2-cropped.jpg"></div><figcaption>Spatial Interview with John Orion Young beside <a href="/artwork/see-these-ice-creams"><em>See These Ice Creams</em></a><em> </em>(2018)</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>So what's the benefit of having the interviews in VR? A huge one is context. In the interview with John Orion Young, for instance, you're not watching a flat video recording, rather, you're standing in the same space with him and his art as it happens. Similarly, the Complex Chaos tour features Colin Northway talking about the technical implementation of the piece while guiding visitors through the room. In this way, the artists can refer to certain aspects of their artwork or the environment they're in, unlocking more opportunities for commentary and immersion. We're experimenting with different formats as well, with Em Halberstadt's interview being a volumetric video recording as opposed to an in-avatar recording within the MOR. This format allows visitors to actually see the artists, inclusive of their likeness and mannerisms.</p><p>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1000px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1000px"><div><img alt="Visitor viewing Em Halberstadt’s volumetric Spatial Interview beside  Capsule (2017)" src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/em-interview.png"></div><figcaption>Visitor viewing Em Halberstadt’s volumetric Spatial Interview beside <a href="/artwork/capsule"><em>Capsule </em></a><em>(2017)</em></figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>To trigger these experiences, pick up any phone you see in the MOR and hold it to your ear, the interview should start immediately. Since they are recorded, you can view the spatial interviews at any time, so there's no need to worry about time zones. There are many directions we'd love to take this feature, but right now, we're excited to hear what you think about it.

    content: `<p>John Orion Young (JOY) uses virtual reality (VR) as a tool for creating unique art pieces that are often sold and exchanged on the Ethereum blockchain. Young's site has been consistently popular with his collectibles generating a lot of activity on the blockchain. In this interview, he touches upon some fascinating aspects of the physicality of creating in the VR medium, digital art ownership and its indexicality.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h4>FAST FACTS</h4><p><strong>Pronouns: </strong></p><p>He, him</p><p><strong>Based in: </strong></p><p>Portland, Oregon</p><p><strong>Hobbies:</strong></p><p>I love to go to the park and see people enjoying the day. And I like to go to the hardware store to look at materials.</p><p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong></p><p>My favourite colour is green, but my favourite colour to wear is yellow. And I like pizza.</p><p>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:940px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="940px"><div><img alt="Photo" src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/artist-spotlight-joy.png"></div></figure><h4><strong>Tell us a bit about yourself. What’s your background?</strong></h4><p>I’m John Orion Young, also known as JOY from <em>JOYWORLD</em>. I make art and virtual reality, and I’m building a magical world for all the JOY creatures to live in.</p><h4><strong>What is a JOY creature?</strong></h4><p>A JOY is a virtual creature conspiring you to be joyful and creative. You can own a JOY and JOYS train you to be happy and creative. They live on Earth too, but only people who own <em>JOY </em>can see<em> JOYWORLD</em>. </p><h4><strong>What does an average day in your life look like?</strong></h4><p>I usually wake up at 5.00 AM in the morning, super pumped to go make things. I drink lots of water, have coffee and maybe eat a bowl of cereal. I usually go into VR for an hour or two, and sculpt. I try to make stuff before I get into the day and lose my dreams. I answer emails, work on different projects, call collaborators. I’m working on getting an investment for JOYWORLD, so there is lots of calling VC people and probably give them the weirdest conversation that they may have to deal with for the week (laughs).</p><h4><strong>How did you get into VR? What did you first make in VR?</strong></h4><p>Way back, I used to make paintings. But I wanted to make a lot of stuff, but not generate a lot of waste or need too many materials and stuff. I remember a video I saw, an early Oculus prototype shared on YouTube, where there was a giant, red spider. It was showing in Mixed Reality and filling the whole room and they were all just sitting in the room casually. And I was like, “Wow, this is the most amazing thing! You can make stuff and have infinite space to create”. I was in SF at the time, and I was trying to find something with a headset and I saw that Best Buy had a headset. So I just went there and tried it, and I think I got chased by a T-Rex. And I was like this is so cool. And from there I got into Tilt Brush, did that for a while. Then the touch controllers came out and that’s when I found Medium and got obsessed with it.</p><p>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2500px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2500px"><div><img alt="Don’t Panic , an exhibit featuring a few pieces created by John Orion Young in Oculus Medium" src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/joy-exhibit.png"></div><figcaption><em>Don’t Panic</em>, an exhibit featuring a few pieces created by John Orion Young in Oculus Medium</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><h4><strong>Oculus Medium is your primary VR tool - what drew you to that?</strong></h4><p>I think that sculpting a giant balloon in the air. And just having this volume of weightless clay. It kind of relates so much to real materials. I’m just kind of drawn to it. You know, the way it feels, it’s stretchy and gooey. It’s really fun and it is hard <em>to not</em> go play with it.<br> &nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Sculpting even as a classical medium is tangible and spatial in nature. How does that training and experience translate for you in your VR workflow?</strong></h4><p>I grew up training in my Dad’s art studio. He is an oil painter and a bronze sculptor. He is into hyper realism and animals. I kind of grew up with a more traditional training. While I was always drawn to digital mediums, it never really latched on for me. </p><p><br>I was very much into paintings and playing with physical stuff, because I like the feeling of moving my body to make something. Once VR came out and I went in and started making stuff in there, it kind of replaced traditional for me. It feels just as real yet it is more surreal. And that makes it more fun!</p><h4><strong>Why this visual style? How did you come to find it?</strong></h4><p>I don’t know, it just keeps coming out of me! I remember that the first thing I sculpted in Medium was a smiley. And I just kept playing with it. You have a ‘move tool’ in Medium that you can use to stretch things, so I kept stretching it for fun. I don’t really draw anything or plan out stuff ahead of time - I just go in and I make the thing. It is usually as if it is trying to escape me. That is kind of my process I guess! That a creature wants out and I must manifest its existence somehow (laughs)</p><p>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1840px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1840px"><div><img alt="A Spatial Interview with John Orion Young beside  See These Ice Creams (2018)" src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/joy-exhibit-2.png"></div><figcaption>A Spatial Interview with John Orion Young beside <em>See These Ice Creams (2018)</em></figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><h4><strong>Could you walk us through your creative process? What are your considerations?</strong></h4><p>Usually I just start in Medium? I’ll just grab a brush and start scribbling, I’ll grab some clay and then stretch it and paint it. I just work with my intuition. There’s a lot of consideration about wanting it to be fun - as I want to have fun - and I want it to be wild. I kind of want it to be something that people find fun and new, to experience. There’s not a lot of rules (laughs) I just let myself do what I want!</p><p>Since JOYS have some human qualities - so sometimes I give them a wristwatch or a special belt, a specific T-shirt they want. So I’ll just make that for them.</p><h4><strong>Let’s talk about your choice of colour and form - about how it speaks to a certain internet language of emotions. Could we speculate how your visual vocabulary sometimes references some natural and capitalistic forms? </strong></h4><p>JOYWORLD definitely wants to be a part of the contemporary conversation. I think it’s good to use certain tropes that exist in the world. The <em>Kitty Hello JOY </em>for example - so many different artists have made their version of Hello Kitty - so it’s almost like JOYWORLD’s take or version. Same with Mickey Mouse, and glimpses of other characters that come into JOYWORLD. &nbsp;</p><p>It has a little bit to do not with where we are in time but also a little bit with ‘the familiar’. Like we can consider the inside of the MoR as an illustration of the same. There isn’t a need for walls and a ceiling but it’s a familiarity to give us scale, give you a scale. It makes it all relevant in our mind and relevant to cultural reality.</p><h4><strong>That allows an interesting segway into the subject of indexicality. Do you think indexicality works differently for Blockchain VR art?</strong></h4><p>The Blockchain part is interesting to me as I love the way digital art can be shared and experienced and relies on indexes online to allow everybody to have it and see it. Unlike a physical painting, when you experience something digital you experience it just the same way that everybody else does. You can experience it on your phone, unlike a painting that you need to go and see in reality.</p><p>The thing that Blockchain does is that it ties a digital thing to reality. It makes it a thing that is like a token. And I like that idea that somebody can own something and it can be unique and special to them - and they can be the owner. But at the same time everyone else can see it and experience it while it is essentially being owned as a piece, say, the MoR. </p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1840px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1840px"><div><img alt="An exhibit featuring  Infinite Fidget  (2019) by John Orion Young in Oculus Medium" src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/infinite-fidget-exhibit.png"></div><figcaption>An exhibit featuring <em>Infinite Fidget</em> (2019) by John Orion Young in Oculus Medium</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><h4><strong>What is it to truly own your artwork? </strong></h4><p>I do not believe that on this Earth anything at all can truly be owned. You can’t permanently own anything as eventually you die. This eventuality puts everything in transition. So even if you own an artwork, you never really own it. So I think my work is kind of a nod to that. </p><p>The way that the JOY art market works is that I’ll sell a JOY, and if somebody is willing to pay more for it, they can always buy it. So nobody actually can own anything. They can only own it temporarily. It’s different from other collectibles on the Blockchain because most collectibles can be owned and kept in your wallet forever. The reason I kind of moved in the opposite direction is because my personal belief is that you cannot own anything in reality. You can own land but the government can take that from you or you can die!</p><p>I am exploring both, the virtual side - more so what I’m heavily into right now - and then I am looking to merge it into reality. So definitely some of the stuff from JOYWORLD will cross over into reality. But I can’t quite discuss ‘how’ (laughs). For now that’s all a secret still!</p><h4><strong>Have you implemented VR into your professional workflow?</strong></h4><p>Definitely. I’ve done a bit of commercial work also and pretty much everything I do is done in Medium.</p><h4><strong>Are you currently working on projects you can talk about?</strong></h4><p>I’m working on JOYWORLD and on an Augmented Reality project with a friend, but I’m not sure if they’re ready to talk about that</p><h4><strong>Tips for artists starting out in VR?</strong></h4><p>Do it! Do it! It’s incredible. It’s just the way. Everything will be in VR in the future. It’s inevitable. These tools are getting so good and I have seen how for other artists too workflows are speeding up with these tools. You might as well jump in now if you’re an artist! Better jump in now instead of waiting around for it to be the norm.</p><h4><strong>Where can we learn more about you?</strong></h4><p>You can go to <a href="https://joy.lol/">Joy.lol</a> - that’s my website.</p><p>—</p><p><em>This interview is part of the MOR Artist Spotlight series, which features creators using VR as an artistic tool or medium of expression.

    image: "/images/blog/kevin-mack-creating-abstract-vr-worlds.jpg",
    content: `<p>Artist and Academy Award winning visual effects pioneer, Kevin Mack received the Oscar for Best Visual Effects for his work on <em>What Dreams May Come</em>. In 2017, &nbsp;Mack released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/497450/Blortasia/">Blortasia</a>, a surreal maze full of colour and sensual undulating shapes, where players float through a calm world in virtual reality (VR), finding vistas of abstract beauty and moments of inward reflection. In this interview, Mack reflects on his creative process, expectations, and his thoughts on the future of immersive art.</p><h3>FAST FACTS</h3><p><strong>Pronouns: </strong></p><p>He, Him</p><p><strong>Based in: </strong></p><p>Los Angeles, California</p><p><strong>Hobbies:</strong></p><p>All my life I’ve been devoted full-time to endeavors that are generally considered hobbies. Anything that could be construed as a hobby in my life is also an integral part of my creative process. I’ve often joked about it. I’m a professional hobbyist, it’s all I do, so in a way, I don’t have any hobbies. Kind of ironic, isn’t it? </p><p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong></p><p>In the ‘80s and early ‘90s, my wife, artist, Snow Mack, and I had a psychedelic art band called The Fringe. We wore our psychedelic painted clothes and played our psychedelic video art on TVs as we performed on stage. When the LA Weekly featured one of our live shows for their pick-of-the-week, they said, “Even if The Fringe’s eclectic brand of psychedelic music isn’t your thing, you’ve got to admit that their freaky-deaky clothes are pretty bitchin”. &nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img alt="ARTIST SPOTLIGHT (2).png" src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/artist-spotlight-2.png"></div></figure><p>‍</p><h4><strong>Tell us a bit about yourself. What’s your background?</strong></h4><p>I grew up drawing, painting, sculpting, and animating. My parents were Disney artists from the early days and I had lots of encouragement and lessons from them and their many artist friends. I studied fine art, illustration, and film at ArtCenter College of Design in Pasadena, California. After college, I supported my experimental art and music working in the film industry doing concept art, storyboards, models, stop motion, scenic painting, you name it. In the late eighties, I got into 3D computer graphics because I’d always dreamed of making virtual reality art and it seemed that technology was finally going to make it possible. The virtual reality thing turned out to be decades away, but I was in the right place at the right time and got to help pioneer the use of computer graphics for visual effects. I enjoyed a nice career creating and supervising visual effects for lots of cool movies and even received an Academy Award for my work on What Dreams May Come. Along the way, I got into neuroscience and artificial life and I kept making my personal art on the side. When VR technology finally became accessible to developers, I left the visual effects industry and have been focused on creating virtual reality art ever since.</p><h4><strong>How did you get into creating VR art?</strong></h4><p>In 1963, when I was four years old, I became fascinated by the Agave plants in my backyard. I was obsessed with their strange, otherworldly forms. One day, I experienced them communicating to me telepathically. I was immersed in incredible virtual reality visions that filled me with awe. The beings explained that they were The Ancient Elders From The Distant Future, and that one day I would help to create their ancestors. </p><p>That vision was the first time I became aware of the concept of virtual reality. It inspired my interest in consciousness, neuroscience, meditation, mysticism, dreaming, and the transcendent experience. It also inspired my interest in natural systems, evolutionary biology, artificial life and artificial intelligence. The first time I actually experienced VR in a headset was in in the late eighties at a short lived VR Arcade in Hollywood. It was terrible, but I could see the potential and it was incredibly exciting. </p><h4><strong>What tools do you use?</strong></h4><p>I’m really into creating my own tools and utilizing existing tools in unique ways that were never intended. I mostly create geometry assets with tools I make in Houdini, but for some stages I’ll do volumetric sculpting in 3D-Coat. I’ve explored VR creation tools like Oculus Medium, Tilt Brush, etc. and they’re really fun and have some undeniable advantages, but I still prefer the abstracted control and inherent capabilities of creating outside of the headset. I expect the VR tools will continue to improve, but there will always be advantages to both approaches. In my work, manual sculpting is only one element of the process. The procedural and rule based systems I create can produce great complexity more efficiently as well as allowing me to discover things I might never imagine. I use Unity to bring everything together and to build my behavior systems. </p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img alt="A Blort sculpture from Mack's  Blortasia , on display in the Museum of Other Realities" src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/blort-graded-28129.jpeg"></div><figcaption>A <a href="/artwork/blort"><em>Blort </em></a>sculpture from Mack's <em>Blortasia</em>, on display in the Museum of Other Realities</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><h4><strong>Could you describe your creative process?</strong></h4><p>My process is largely experimental. I like to explore ideas and processes without a specific goal in mind. I’m engaged in a constant search for novelty and my aesthetic ideal, which was likely formed by my visions, dreams, imagination, and to some extent, the sum of my experience. There could also be some aspect of it that’s genetically defined. Or maybe it was programmed in there by the Ancient Elder Agave plants when I was four. </p><h4><strong>How does sound fit into this experimental process and your work?</strong></h4><p>Music and sound design have always been an important aspect of my artistic practice. Virtual reality is the ultimate medium to realize my lifelong ambition of integrating my audio and visual art. For Zen Parade and Blortasia, I felt a relaxing neural entrainment sound bath would best complement the visual neural entrainment of the imagery. I experimented with some spatial audio elements, but it was both computationally expensive and too distracting for what I was trying to achieve. For Anandala, the addition of complex artificial life Blorts, with their musical language, the integration of spatial audio was essential. I created a new neural entrainment soundscape, then I spent months developing a musical language and the Blort voice module. The Blorts all have unique voices and styles of expression. They compose their own musical speech. I don't use any samples or predetermined phrasing. Developing their musical language was quite a rabbit hole, but I'm really glad I went down it. Hearing the Blorts express themselves in their own language is a most surreal and gratifying experience.<br> </p><h4><strong>Let's talk about distribution. How do you exhibit or publish your work? </strong></h4><p>I've exhibited my work around the world at tech expos, conferences, film festivals, and art gallery and museum exhibits and events. Zen Parade is available on the Oculus Store and Blortasia is on Steam and in a bunch of VR arcades. Zen Parade has been used in a clinical study as a hypnoanalgesic to treat pain and anxiety during thirty awake brain surgeries. Blortasia is used in therapy and clinical studies are pending. Distribution is a bit of a conundrum for me. My work is abstract art, entertainment, therapeutic, a tool for neuroscience research, and some people use it in their spiritual practice. People of all ages and from all walks of life enjoy it and find it beneficial in a variety of ways, but that makes it challenging to know how to promote or distribute it. </p><p>There are a variety of expectations associated with different means of exhibition and distribution. Currently, one of the best things about VR art is that many people have no idea what to expect. That can be great because they experience the work in an open/receptive state. Of the different exhibiting contexts and venues, the art/science museum exhibits have been the most rewarding and enjoyable for me. Galleries and collectors are starting to talk about how to buy and sell VR art, so I'm eager to see where that leads.</p><p>With the video game distribution platforms, expectations have been more of a challenge. Those platforms were developed for commercial games with mass audiences. Expectations for price and game-based content can make distribution of VR art in those arenas somewhat frustrating. I'm hoping MOR will provide more visibility for VR artists and help establish an audience for VR art within that world. </p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center" style="padding-bottom:33.75%" data-rt-type="video" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-height="33.75%" data-rt-dimensions="0:0"><div><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aKKk3Hxvxjo?wmode=opaque&enablejsapi=1" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></figure><p>A trailer for Mack’s <em>Blortasia</em>, available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/497450/Blortasia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a>!</p><h4><strong>Where do you see the medium heading in the future?</strong></h4><p>The potential applications of VR are vast and broad, but I think it’s greatest potential may be as an artistic medium. The fundamental innovation of VR is the ability to communicate spatial presence. Throughout history artists and architects have used spatial presence to mediate our experience of reality. What’s exciting to me is the ability to mediate the experience of reality, unconstrained by actual reality. </p><h4><strong>What about access and reach? VR is growing in popularity, but it isn't quite mainstream. This means, at this point, only a handful of people (those with headsets) can experience your work. How do you feel about that? &nbsp;</strong></h4><p>In the several decades I waited for VR technology to be viable, I never thought much about VR becoming a mainstream industry. I wanted VR so I could transport myself and others into my virtual art worlds. I am beyond happy that I can do that now. In my experience, the best time to be doing something is before it becomes mainstream, while it's still new and exciting. I love that when people experience my VR art, it's often their first VR experience. Of course it will be great when more people can access VR art and VR artists can reach a bigger audience, but right now is a magical time. If VR becomes commonplace, at least some of that magic will be lost.</p><h4><strong>Are you currently working on projects you’d like to share?</strong></h4><p>I’m still adding some embellishments, but I’ve started sharing previews of my latest project, <a href="http://www.kevinmackart.com/anandala.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anandala</a>. It’s a huge three-dimensional mandala of evolving shapes and colors that you fly around in and explore. It’s like a bigger, better Blortasia. The Blorts, my abstract, artificial-life entities, now have complex emergent behavior. They express themselves and interact with visitors and each other through complex movement, changing color textures, and their own musical language. They’re creative and very friendly. So far, people seem to really connect with them emotionally. I know I have.</p><h4><strong>Do you have any tips or advice for people looking to get into creating VR art?</strong></h4><p>Jump in. Experiment. Make something new.

    content: `<p>On Wednesday, November 25th 2020, at 6.00 PM PST, two pioneers from the VR art industry are going to be in conversation about matters of value, ownership, and data collection in the VR art industry. At this event, they will be generously sharing their perspective on the genesis of VR and its current growth trajectories, in real time.&nbsp;<br></p><p>We have the honor to be hosting immersive artist, scientist and creator Jacki Morie; bringing us scoop on what-was-hot in VR in the 1990s, and sculptor and technologist John Orion Young; explaining the crypto-economics of his art. </p><p>‍<br></p><h3>When Pixels were Precious&nbsp;</h3><p><em>by Jacki Morie</em><br></p><p>Jacquelyn Ford Morie (or Jacki Morie) is an artist, scientist and educator working in the areas of immersive worlds, games and social networks since the 1990s. Until 2013 she was a Senior Research Scientist at the Institute for Creative Technologies at which point she started her company, <a href="http://alltheseworldsllc.com/">All These Worlds</a>, to take her work in virtual worlds and avatars to a broader audience.<br></p><p>It’s important though to go beyond the above description given how this iron lady is a ‘futurist’ with her brand smattered across several disciplines and intersections; across research, education and early adoption of VR technology, starting with significant contributions to the early perceptual and navigational studies for the Army Research Institute.&nbsp;</p><p>In her talk at the MOR though she’s bringing her artist self forward, accepting quite bluntly how much of her artwork has gotten lost because of the short lifespan of technology, but also how much the current VR wave has gained as it perches atop messy cables she has both held and then stowed away, over the years.<br><br></p><h3>Ownership in the Metaverse&nbsp;</h3><p><em>by John Orion Young</em><br></p><p>As some may note, John Orion Young (aka JOY from <a href="https://www.joy.lol/">JOY World</a>) has exhibited several works in the MOR in the past. We’re happy to have him return as a speaker this time, as who has ever said they’re done asking their questions about crypto? As he’d be describing his experiences and experiments with creating smart contracts with tokens and removing ownership from the Blockchain - he has a solid lot to offer when it comes to building realistic financial systems on top of art that exists virtually.<br></p><p>The contrast between the two speakers quickly shrinks when we take into account the fact that they’ve both had to hack a monetization aspect in their own special style, as novel VR artists. Jacki would be sharing her technically diverse journey as she saw equipment come and go, from shiny to redundant. While John intends to share his rule of thumb - “Don’t trust, verify”, as he advances furthermore into Ethereum and brings AR into the picture to help his collectors own their JOYs in augmented proximity.<br></p><p>We expect this talk to become as philosophical as pragmatic, knowing the speakers’ frames of reference. Both Jacki and John, are ready to cut deep into the subject of art ownership, the lack of future proof gear and formats, and the role of financial systems that could help sustain this beast of a medium.</p><p>So Let's Get Real, if you're ready?<br></p><p>*The event will begin at 6.00 PM PST on Wednesday, November 25th 2020.<br>A Q&amp;A discussion will follow, and artists will take questions from attendees.<br></p>`

What’s your background?</strong></h4><p>I was a 2D illustrator and graphic designer in my former life.</p><h4><strong>Do you remember your first VR experience?</strong></h4><p>The first thing I tried was Tilt Brush and it quickly began consuming the majority of my waking hours. Suffice it to say, I enjoyed it. A lot.</p><h4><strong>Would you say your prior work experience prepared you for the medium in any way?</strong></h4><p>Previous to VR, I was working as a designer and illustrator. While I'll admit that my knowledge of 2D design doesn't come into play nearly as much as I would like, my skillset in VR is built directly on top of my skills as a 2D illustrator. My work in figure drawing and gesture-based illustration has been integral to my style and precision in VR painting programs. &nbsp;</p><h4><strong>What tools do you use?</strong></h4><p>Mostly mark-making based VR applications, Tilt Brush, Quill, and AnimVR. I fell in love with Tilt for the same reasons as everyone else, the learning curve was almost non-existent and the mark-making experience feels like actual magic when you first try it.</p><h4><strong>Are there limitations to using the tools? &nbsp;</strong></h4><p>When working with VR tools you'll pretty quickly find hard restrictions, especially when dealing with animations. It's very tough to work cleanly and efficiently so file size becomes an issue you'll run into pretty frequently and then, of course, textures. Right now the solutions for texturing the models you create in VR are not nearly as bountiful as the drawing/sculpting solutions.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2500px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2500px"><div><img alt="Micah404’s  Neo-Hanuka  (2018) on display in the Museum of Other Realities.

There's a lot of experimentation, sometimes it feels like its two steps forward and one step back and you definitely won't find a lot of instructors recommending it, but when I've spent a lot of time planning what a piece is going to look like before executing I rarely stick to my own plan. I definitely see the value in it planning ahead, just not something that's worked for me. </p><h4><strong>So where do you get the ideas for your work?</strong></h4><p>Steal them mostly. I'm much better at shaping ideas than I am at coming up with them, so I love to collaborate. I have been fortunate enough to surround myself with really talented people with a knack for coming with incredible ideas throughout my career. What I really enjoy is parsing them, when you have a great idea on your hands the next step is to get to the core of what’s driving it and amplify. </p><h4><strong>Talking about surrounding yourself with talented people, who are your biggest influences?</strong></h4><p>Tomer Hanuka. All my color palette choices are based around concepts I learned from him. He's also the direct inspiration behind my piece in the MOR gallery which is a master copy of an alternate cover for the legendary manga, Akira. In terms of VR work, I credit Liz Edwards for showing me what’s possible in the medium, by the time I got my hands on Tilt Brush they were already featuring a bunch of great work in the game and her work was far and away my favorite.

Another gem is that there is almost no place for negative comments in collabs, nobody wants to work with the XR Gordon Ramsay. Constructive criticism is crucial to sharpening your product/team but you have to be surgical in your approach and solution-driven otherwise the atmosphere can become toxic very quickly.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="padding-bottom:56.25%" data-rt-type="video" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-height="56.25%" data-rt-dimensions="0:0"><div><iframe src="https://poly.google.com/view/0pk0RWY2PLE/embed?wmode=opaque" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></figure><p><em>Illustrated by Micah404 in Tilt Brush</em></p><p>‍</p><h4><strong>Where do you see VR heading in the future?</strong></h4><p>I've always thought we would see mainstream adoption in the conceptual stages of workflows.

Most of the XR content that is anchored in IP coming from traditional media has been pretty bad. When it’s done right (i.e. Pokemon Go) it can have a massive viewership from people new to the field. New mediums, strange hardware that goes on your face, beta UIs, 45 min waits at film festivals, it's all just such a huge ask of our audience to even experience our material, existing IP that people are already connected to is the only proven way to convince the masses. </p><h4><strong>Are you currently working on any projects you’d like to share?</strong></h4><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Hiraeth404/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hiraeth</a>, an XR universe built entirely in Tilt Brush. &nbsp; </p><h4><strong>Great!

    content: `<p>Michelle Brown is a Brisbane based multidisciplinary artist interested in interactive immersive installations. Michelle has created virtual reality (VR) music videos and visuals for a variety of artists and organisations as well as exhibiting her work around the world. &nbsp;In this interview, Michelle talks about her workflow and what it’s like to create and showcase a VR installation.</p><p> </p><p>‍</p><h3>FAST FACTS</h3><p><strong>Pronouns: </strong></p><p>She/Her</p><p><strong>Based in: </strong></p><p>Brisbane, Australia</p><p><strong>Hobbies</strong>:</p><p>My cat is my main hobby outside of work, when I have any spare time I just want to hang out with her. She’s 20 so every moment I have left with her I’m thankful.</p><p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong></p><p>When I left my former role as manager at a local radio station they put up a commemorative plaque in the bathroom for me, mainly because I helped renovate the bathroom but also because I’d put in many years and dedication to the place haha. </p><p>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img alt="ARTIST SPOTLIGHT - Michelle Brown.png" src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/artist-spotlight-michelle-brown.png"></div></figure><p>‍</p><h4><strong>Tell us a bit about yourself. What’s your background?</strong></h4><p>I’m a multidisciplinary artist and producer based in Brisbane, Australia. I’ve been a graphic artist for about 20 years, I first studied fashion and illustration but then started working in the music industry, I did a lot of design work for venues and bands like album covers, posters etc. In the early 2000s I did a degree in Multimedia and this is where I became pretty fascinated by computer technology and arts practice. We covered a bit of everything, from 2D Flash animation, 3D design and gaming to traditional film and audio design. </p><p>I ended up a bit sidetracked in the music world for a while, working as an editor for music press and then taking a job managing my local community radio station for 8 years, I was also playing in bands and organizing shows, so I didn’t have much time but I was able to remain actively designing album art, creating videos and the occasional exhibition piece. </p><p>In 2016 I made the decision to quit my full time job to focus on my own creative projects, I had started to play around with augmented reality, using my illustration and animation work, and around this time I was following what was going on with VR. By 2017 I had saved enough to get a Vive headset and PC to run it, it’s definitely a privileged space to be in, as the expense is limiting for a lot of people. </p><p>Right now I independently produce music visuals and videos for a few different outlets and on request basis, similarly with my VR installation work which is usually commission based, and I work at my state library in the makerspace, which is a great place to experiment with new technology and fabrication techniques. <br></p><h4><strong>How did you get into creating art in VR? At what point did it seem like a viable medium for you to work in?</strong></h4><p>Seeing what the VR art programs could do was definitely the most inspiring part of what enticed me into the space, and the small community of artists starting to build a bit of a movement, early on Cesar’s (3Donimus) resources were really amazing to help learn more about different software. I mainly started working with Tilt Brush, it felt so natural and all the flashy bells and whistles (I’m talking about the brushes hah) were perfect for some of the music visuals work I was doing. </p><p>I’ve been lucky to have been approached to do work for music artists and immersive installations early on into my VR path, so it’s been great to be able to concentrate on this area of my arts practice and get paid for it.</p><h4><strong>Tilt Brush seems to be your primary VR art tool. What drew you to it?</strong></h4><p>One thing I liked about Tilt Brush early on was the sketchbook section and discovering other artist’s work, some of it was super inspiring. There were 2 pieces that come to mind that helped me to see how I could translate my more traditional 2d design work into VR. First one is Liz Edwards’ Spaceship piece and the other is Valerian VR from Steve Teeple. These are both sci-fi pieces and that’s a subject I focus a lot on so I was drawn to these and it kinda clicked into place for me how I could approach some of my own work in a virtual environment. </p><p>I also just love experimenting in VR, trying different techniques and styles, mainly using Tilt Brush as it’s the app I’ve spent the most time in so the controls all feel the most natural. I have a Vive, and a Quest now, but I’m considering a Rift S too as I’m really keen to experiment more with Quill and a few other platform specific apps. TB is great but I want to do more with animation and storytelling in the future. </p><p>I’ve tried most of the VR art software, I facilitate workshops in using VR and AR in arts practice so I like to be up to date on what’s available, even if I haven’t had time to master it, which is the case lately for a lot of things I want to work on, too many ideas and not enough time.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center" style="padding-bottom:33.75%" data-rt-type="video" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-height="33.75%" data-rt-dimensions="0:0"><div><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/338822918?app_id=122963&wmode=opaque" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></figure><h4><strong>Could you walk us through your creative process? For instance, you recently worked on the music video for leaving richmond’s ‘</strong><a href="https://youtu.be/gDhqJ3GoPkg"><strong>The Curvature of the Earth</strong></a><strong>’. How did you approach that in VR?</strong></h4><p>That was such a great project to be involved in, Jordan (leaving richmond) reached out online to ask me about doing a clip for a track from his album, he was super great and gave me a few tracks to choose from and Curvature of the Earth musically really connected with an idea I had just started working on. </p><p>I love seventies sci-fi art and had been wanting to create a piece inspired by the Stanford Torus, a proposed NASA design for a space habitat that was painted by several artists in 1975. The song suited what I wanted to create and Jordan was in to the idea. The concept of the clip was to feel like you are moving through a tunnel in space to arrive at a new colony, I wanted to keep the idea of continuous motion by using the camera to travel through the VR painted environments. </p><p>Depending on what kind of project I’m working on, I have a few different ways that I approach things, for example with music videos I’ll usually do a storyboard and make sure the artist is cool with the direction I’m wanting to take and then it’s just getting stuck in to creating. With installation work I do a lot more pre-planning and brainstorming.<br></p><h4><strong>You exhibited <em>Looking Glass </em>at The Other Art Fair in Melbourne this year. What was the experience of showcasing an ‘immersive’ installation like? </strong></h4><p>This was the second VR room scale installation I’d exhibited, the first one I did in LA in 2018 I learned a lot from, mainly around how hands on it kind of needs to be, as in it’s best to have someone there to help fit the headset and make sure people feel ok as they walk around a 20ft space, we had a lot of new to VR people come through and you want to make sure they have a great experience. I’d created this neon maze, people loved it but they also all wanted to finish the maze and we didn’t count on the installation being so popular so there were long waiting lines. </p><p>For the Melbourne installation Looking Glass, I wanted it to take less time but still be a somewhat interactive experience through utilizing the 20ft space I had available again. I also wanted this piece to focus more on a diorama style approach, accented by the space itself, every wall individually designed and presented in a doorway style with hallways. I was inspired by those bright coloured retro bathing houses, my local pool still has that style, and also people’s perception of boundaries and how I could influence their decisions through virtual structures. .</p><h4><strong>You’re a member of quite a few XR communities. What motivated you to get involved?</strong></h4><p>I’ve worked a lot in non profit, community driven organisations, so I know how important building a community of support can be. It’s nice to share knowledge and ask questions with people working in similar ways with VR and AR art, I think the more we encourage others to be part of this new thing then the more people are picking up VR headsets not only as creators but also consumers, which in turn leads to more opportunities for creativity and experimentation.</p><p>There’s so many great online groups currently in the XR space, I’ve made some great virtual and real life friends through connecting over different programs and new techniques. XR Artists Collective is great, as is We Make Reality.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img alt="Glass Cities  (2018) by Michelle Brown in Tilt Brush" src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/glass-cities.png"></div><figcaption><em>Glass Cities </em>(2018) by Michelle Brown in Tilt Brush</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><h4><strong>Where do you see VR heading in the future? </strong></h4><p>I think that immersive and interactive exhibitions will continue to be popular, and XR can contribute to these in super creative ways. I also think more curated experiences like the MOR will start to pop up to showcase VR art as more people get headsets and start viewing and creating. </p><p>As a tool for creation it’s a really exciting area right now, some of the work being made in VR with programs like Quill and Tvori is amazing. Those and apps like Unity, which you can utilise not only for making games, but also to build VR and AR experiences. </p><p>But I think one of the main challenges will be the slower adoption rates, without more engaging content there won’t be a substantial increase in new VR users so things will just plod along incrementally. I don’t mind the gaming side of VR but I believe that as a community we need to focus further afield, as a consumer I want more creative content, but there still needs to be more investment and funding for artists available in this space to diversify the voices and the content.</p><h4><strong>Are you currently working on projects or pieces you’d like to share?</strong></h4><p>I’m currently working on a gallery installation piece that will feature VR, interactive projection mapping and audio accompaniment. I was lucky enough to receive funding through a Creative Sparks grant from Brisbane City Council, and I really want to push myself as well as create something immersive and interactive. I’ve got a few months to work on this so looking forward to getting stuck into it. &nbsp;</p><p>Installations and music videos have been my main focus in the VR space, but I’ve also been trying to get time to work on a VR animated film, so hopefully that will be on the cards soon.</p><h4><strong>Do you have any tips or advice for people looking to get into creating VR art?</strong></h4><p>I think just trying a few of the VR art programs and seeing what suits your style is a good way to start out. Connect with other artists so you have a support and inspiration network.</p><h4><strong>Where can we find out more about you and your work?</strong></h4><p>You can follow me on most of the social platforms as @thebadlament and also on my website I’ve started a blog page that follows my Adventures in XR - https://www.thebadlament.com/</p><p><br>—</p><p><em>This interview is part of the MOR Artist Spotlight series, which features creators using VR as an artistic tool or medium of expression.

    content: `<p>We’ve been quiet recently, and we’re really sorry about that. But don’t worry, we haven’t gone anywhere. In fact, we’re thrilled to announce that <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1StlENQvBggwoeTixhmFXNwYjtCOkRPwf/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we’ve closed a Series A investment round</a>. This has been in the works for a while and is exciting in many ways; the funding allows us to provide more support to the artists we feature while making sure the Museum is the best it can be as we move closer to release.</p><p>The Museum has come a long way since we started working on it in 2017. At the time, it wasn’t a museum at all, at least not in the way it is now. Rather, we were fascinated by the work people were creating with VR, and wanted to do something with these artists. Considering some of the friction involved with VR experiences (discovery, access, actually putting on the headset, etc.), the original idea was to make something along the lines of a ‘virtual magazine’, where it would be easier to experience all the art in one place, as opposed to having each piece be its own app. With this early version of theMOR—or TH-er—as we called it then, we were more focused on having it be a gateway to different standalone experiences. It wasn’t until we implemented multiplayer and hosted our first experimental party, that we realized the potential for this space. From that point, we were confident about the direction we wanted to take the project.</p><p>Since then, we’ve had the opportunity to feature amazing work created by equally amazing <a href="/artists">artists</a>. From the start, we’ve been intent on supporting artists by paying them for their work, and we’re glad to now be able to do that on a larger scale. Through our parties, we’ve worked to build a community around this new medium--a space for people to not only appreciate the artwork but to also interact with one another, which is crucial for an emerging medium like VR. </p><p>Suffice to say, it has definitely been a learning experience. So much has changed in theMOR and in the VR space as a whole, but our goal of working with artists to define what is possible in virtual reality has remained the same. We want to thank the artists and everyone who has volunteered or contributed to the Museum. It’s difficult to describe in words how much we appreciate the support.</p><p>Now we have an actual office, which opens new doors for collaboration and community outreach. We’re also pleased to welcome a few people to the team. You might know Andy Moore, Lindsay Jorgensen, and Stephen Gray from their work on the VR game <em>Fantastic Contraption</em>, and Adam Madojemu, who co-directed the VR music video, <em>Pixel Hearts. </em>It has been a surreal experience watching this grow from a simple idea to being able to work on theMOR in this capacity with a team of talented people. </p><p>The Museum is expanding and we’re excited to have you along with us.</p><p><strong>What’s Next for the Museum of Other Realities</strong></p><p>In addition to some new features and improvements, we’re officially opening our doors to the public later this year.</p><p>Before then, we will hold more private parties in the MOR, so stay tuned for announcements. Looking forward to seeing you THere!</p><p>‍</p>`

We're also glad to have worked with so many amazing artists who have contributed so much to the MOR.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="padding-bottom:56.206088992974244%" data-rt-type="video" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-height="56.206088992974244%" data-rt-dimensions="854:480" data-page-url="https://youtu.be/zUtqvp1LIcM"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zUtqvp1LIcM"></iframe></div></figure><p>‍</p><p>This is, by far, one of the biggest updates we've made to the MOR, so here's a relatively brief rundown of some of the changes to expect.</p><h3>New Architecture</h3><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2286px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2286px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/night-snow-new-museum-v2-bright-cropped-lite-2.jpg"></div><figcaption><a href="/artwork/night-snow"><em>Night Snow</em></a> (2017) by <a href="/artists/danny-bittman">Danny Bittman</a></figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>This isn't the MOR you remember, it's much bigger and bolder, with a new design and artwork spanning two floors. We wanted to give the art in the museum more space to breathe, without overwhelming visitors all at once. &nbsp;The MOR team went back and forth with artists and architects over the last year to create a space that aims to blow the audience away. The size of the museum introduces another element we're excited about: discovery. With the breadth of this new space, the MOR becomes a place you can return to and always find something new.</p><h3>New Art</h3><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1366px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1366px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/morimmateria-1366x768.png"></div><figcaption><a href="/artwork/immateria"><em>IM || MATERIA</em></a> (2019) by <a href="/artists/isaac-cohen">Isaac Cohen</a></figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>MOR 1.0 is filled with fantastic works from the likes of Rosie Summers (@VR_Rosie), Kevin Mack (<a href="https://twitter.com/KevinMackArt">@KevinMackArt</a>), Isaac Cohen (<a href="https://twitter.com/Cabbibo">@Cabbibo)</a>, Liz Edwards (<a href="https://twitter.com/lizaledwards">@lizaledwards</a>), Nick Ladd (<a href="https://twitter.com/NickTheLadd">@NickTheLadd</a>), and Vladimir Ilic (<a href="https://twitter.com/vr_human">@vr_human</a>).</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1366px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1366px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/mor-devalaya-rupanam-1366x768.png"></div><figcaption><a href="/artwork/devalaya-rupanam"><em>Devalaya Rupanam</em></a> (2020) by <a href="/artists/kevin-mack">Kevin Mack</a></figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>A few pieces such as Devalaya Rupanam by Kevin Mack and IM || MATERIA by Isaac Cohen were inspired by and designed around the spaces they inhabit, overlapping with the architecture and provide new means of traversing the museum.</p><h3>Improved Wayfinding and Navigation</h3><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:806px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="806px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/mor-waypoint-large-border-lite.gif"></div><figcaption>Setting a waypoint on the map</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>With improved navigation systems, finding art, locating your friends, and meeting new ones is easier and more intuitive than it has ever been. When designing the new space, we had to figure out ways to ensure visitors can get around the museum. As a result, the map became even more central to the MOR and is one of the first landmarks you come across when you step in. When you hover over a pin on the map, you're not only presented with more info about the artwork but also a light ribbon that guides you to its location. Plus, if you find yourself lost deep within the museum, you can always return to the map by teleporting up.</p><h3>Revamped Avatar Customization and Social Controls</h3><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:806px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="806px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/mor-avatar-customization-border-lite.gif"></div><figcaption>Modifying your avatars with sliders and levers</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>We've made it easier to customize your appearance even further with our upgraded avatar system. While you could already mix and match different head and body types, you can now grab the sliders to modify or distort the parts even more to create an avatar that's unique to you.</p><p>And with UI/UX improvements to inputs and social controls, you no longer have to fiddle with flat-screen menus to find friends and interact with them.</p><p>There are a few other things we don't want to spoil, so we can't wait for you to try it out. Working with architects and artists over the last several months has been fantastic, nothing we are doing would be possible without the creative contributions of so many talented individuals, we hope you are as enthralled as we are with MOR 1.0.</p><p>You can download the Museum of Other Realities on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/613900/Museum_of_Other_Realities/">Steam</a> or <a href="https://www.viveport.com/apps/97d178c8-001c-4d09-a6bd-26cad79e31b3/Museum_of_Other_Realities/">Viveport</a>.</p><p>‍</p>`

    date: "Nov 03, 2020",
    image: "/images/blog/nick-ladd-on-handcrafting-3d-animation-in-vr.jpg",
    content: `<p>Nick Ladd is a Canadian VR artist from Montreal, with a background in illustration and 3D animation. He studied at both Dawson College in Montreal and Sheridan College in Oakville. As a VR artist, he also spearheaded the learning resource, <a href="https://www.animbrushacademy.com/">Animbrush Academy</a>, and co-founded <a href="https://studiosyro.com/">Studio Syro</a>, an animation studio using the VR painting tool 'Quill' to produce hand-crafted experiences.</p><blockquote>“I got my start in Illustration and then eventually moved to doing 3D animation and 3D modelling - it’s what I went to study at art school. The main reason for moving to 3D was to bring a more illustrative feeling to my work. When I was starting out, everything in 3D was trying to look like a Pixar movie.”&nbsp;<br></blockquote><p>And treating Pixar like the sun, as many of his contemporaries would, didn’t seem like an exciting route to Nick. Given how his beginnings were in illustration, he wanted to take what he’d learnt there and unfold it in 3D. Nick shared how, a few years ago, this notion seemed equal parts wishful and impossible, unless perhaps some sort of ‘computer genius’ took a shot at it. The level of shader complexity required would have come in the way of making things look fluid and effortless, especially looking at how high effort 3D animation is. Furthermore, conceiving and executing the technical steps to experiment this way--to blend dimensional boundaries--seemed cumbersome to say the least.<br></p><p>With the first emergence of VR headsets in the market, a noticeable number of artists began creating illustrative 3D pieces using early VR creation apps. These were striking enough to convince a younger Nick that adopting the technology early could prove worthwhile.<br></p><blockquote>“After experiencing an impressive VR simulation of ‘The Wall’ (from Game of Thrones), I bought my first VR headset - an Oculus CV1 - which really wasn’t capable of much actually. But even then, given how new it all, I felt invested. I watched a few short films which blew my mind, just with being able to look all around me. You could not move, the way you can with modern headsets, but you could still look around and see three-dimensional environments.”<br></blockquote><p>Soon after, he picked up the Oculus Rift and started to use Quill. Curious to learn the chops, he tested out the software and even merged them into his 3D workflow. Today, in 2020, he has left behind most of the other tools he used to rely on. Nick reports having found a broader scope and an optimized functionality for his projects fulfilled by Quill in his updated workflow.&nbsp;<br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1600px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1600px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/n7munjnpfkulcdhrk4hwyqpx6nko584cdxtg0d3eb7ldwajsebdw2j-swcvygqthcyqw_bo-r9m69tiqa4y1xrhjvkxrv_yxhzztn7rp-20bdquxazvvcy_6u0f-2nj1kcvmriec.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div><figcaption>‘Port Town’ by Nick Ladd in Quill</figcaption></figure><p>‍<br></p><blockquote>“My workflow - 5 years ago - was kind of the typical pipeline known for 3D work. We’d do concept art, we’d take that concept art into Maya, we would do a 3D model of the character, make that character, animate that character, do textures, and so on. It was very much a 10-step process to get to an end result. But now, using Quill, I kind of arrive at a similar outcome all in one place.”<br></blockquote><p>If you’re not familiar with Quill, here’s what is important to know - when creating in Quill, one can paint colors directly in 3D space, and even animate just by moving the geometry without the need for a rigging or texturing process. So as an artist, you could potentially do your concept art in the same step as that in which you execute the animation.&nbsp;</p><p>What this cuts through is not just many steps, departments, and specialists - but also many phases known to be staged in separate animation and 3D modelling software.<br></p><p>As Nick comes with training in illustration and narrative, even at the very start what excited him most was the abundance that VR brought to storytelling. A few years ago the main allure was how his images had escaped the frame around them, and how viewers were immersing themselves in his vision. In more technical terms, early VR art was borrowing assets that weren’t necessarily created directly in or for VR. The first VR artists were sometimes playing with 3D lungs rigged the old school way, and then asking them to live and breathe in VR air. Nick told us how he decided in that early appeal phase itself, that he’d give into what comes, as the tech levelled up to suit his artistic purposes.&nbsp;</p><h3>‍<br>On Becoming a VR Artist<br></h3><p>When Nick was working on his final 3D animation film as a student, he had a chance to see how the 3D animation tools he was given stood in stark comparison to the VR tools he was experimenting with on the side.<br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1600px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1600px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/c2i3bcj-yovuobvuyinn4p7lg43oyeuuc7tpwzc0eqfj9jrbyqoxkzylmudvprevv-mqmdyw791vzloorngjebhfo3ete9dapf-psf8h6qfuaixoe8kif0-chlhsqigyfnhbt1md.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div><figcaption>‘Life Drawing in VR’ by Nick Ladd</figcaption></figure><p>‍<br></p><blockquote>“Every evening I’d be making a new piece in VR, in about a few hours. I would have in front of me a beautiful scene with animation, and in full colour. Then I’d go back to school where my student film was underway, where the output from two weeks of work would just be a single small shot.”&nbsp;<br></blockquote><p>As it was an investment decision, Nick knew that the tiresome, old fashioned way had a clearer promise to lead to jobs in the industry. But there was no arguing that the VR techniques were way more intriguing and rewarding too, especially with the way people were responding to it. When Nick graduated, he felt prepared to take a leap of faith and go into VR art full time. The feeling of being ‘in-on-a-secret’ convinced him that this was an opportunity for him to pioneer something. For him, the scope to innovate in this medium has been and continues to be a real driving factor.<br></p><p>‍</p><h3>On Current Creative Process/ Workflow<br></h3><p>Nick’s process used to normally begin on paper because ideas come by as one goes through daily life, right? And so he would write them down. The expected next step used to be to draw sketches, on paper. But at this point in his career, Nick finds that just getting to the artwork in Quill itself has become a smoother workflow. Even the concept art for his recent pieces were birthed directly in VR. After some visual research and reference collection, he now puts together everything that looks good into a single document using Photoshop. Once done with that, he imports it into Quill. From there begins a translation of the 2D mood board images into a congruent 3D scene.&nbsp;<br></p><p>When there's animation involved, sometimes material on YouTube helps. If not, he records himself doing some kind of action or movement. That reference is useful for preventing the animation from looking weightless or silly. The rest of the steps are done entirely in Quill.&nbsp;<br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:800px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="800px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/vsyver9pu-9wiqe9zto9ttbkecbn49cc-lprgkwxepsyh_w0_rj8escfkhpx-4hroghczamsvbg8d673wplk1y_acql9qwsmqje-kbnlt5ey7jx35ahfdoswevejuurqn4fe7ti.gif" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div><figcaption>‘Sellsword’ by Nick Ladd created in Quill</figcaption></figure><p>‍<br></p><blockquote>“When it comes to VR storytelling, especially the stuff in Quill, the environment is a character by itself. As you're positioning your viewers into the environment. So when it comes to Quill stuff, people resonate more with the environment than they do with the characters. The characters don't really have any way to interact with the viewer and even if they are animated, they seem to behave like they’re leaving you out.”<br></blockquote><p>Some apps and experiences today add extra interaction or details, like, you could hold the character's hands or perhaps pass props from the scene to characters to add a touch of interactivity. The trends in Quill animations though are one-off scenes that depict isolated experiences. Such environment focused pieces are quite popular because you can walk around the scene, look over a property, or hide behind the dirty edge of something, and feel fairly real even if the characters don’t feel so.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><blockquote>“I like to think about the character as much as his world, but in VR it kind of overlaps. While this does conflict with my background as a character designer, I see how Quill makes me consider the confluence of both character and environment. But I think the environments are the most important in my stories.”<br></blockquote><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:600px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="600px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/q5vapncry3e3bpo-hbc8wkaeig8x5sm-hdu0pmxqjbcn0lqn1h7bjgn4xaevl_ueypss-oqgdn84oxe28f_vl2pb9ejeiuvn_ojbvqq_a71ifhgaelpj4dzfhz9dxdjynkizfwa0.gif" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div><figcaption>‘Biker’ by Nick Ladd created in Quill</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><h3>‘Prey’ and ‘Prehistoric’ in the MOR<br></h3><blockquote>“I like to usually tell a story about a small moment. I think my motivation is to take people someplace magical, someplace interesting that might not be possible in physical reality. That’s been a main goal with both my stories and the worlds that I create.”<br></blockquote><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1600px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1600px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/yvm8vpv25dccnnzybcbmprosoeowunq3iht4tlmzdrobb0drw0oygka526ujfnxtm5widb3bo7artzf_22hal9nbf15k0lpeerwnrwglb1ppe1imaeugtyx96nmn8upggn067uj0.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div><figcaption>‘Prey’ in the MOR by Nick Ladd</figcaption></figure><p>‍<br>For the piece, <a href="/artwork/prey"><em>Prey</em></a>, Nick wanted the focus to be on the characters. The environment itself could be deduced owing to the way the narrative was positioned between the characters. They were designed in a way that the real allure starts with the vibrant, saturated look of feathers and plumes that some may have seen in paleographic art from the past few years. The piece has a powerful moment where it allows people to experience the situation by standing beside a dinosaur in all its scale and ferocity.&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>“So I actually love having this in the museum because a lot of the best museums have dinosaurs, don’t they? So you see like a virtual museum with a dinosaur, not quite anything you've seen before.”&nbsp;<br></blockquote><p>Some easter eggs from the piece, Nick mentioned, are sound cues to stumble upon. The lady in the piece is holding a large egg that one could miss. But if you actually go and touch that egg, you'll hear a ferocious roar from the dinosaur, which could be a little bit frightening. You can also teleport yourself onto the back of the dinosaur if you get the right angle. From that perspective you gain a nice sense of height and scale that you wouldn’t get if this was just an image on a monitor.<br></p><p>The second piece is called&nbsp;<a href="/artwork/prehistoric"><em>Prehistoric</em></a>. These pieces are part of a series of dinosaur illustrations he created around the same time. While in ‘<em>Prey</em>’, the motivation was to showcase some carnivorous dinosaurs, in ‘<em>Prehistoric</em>’ some less threatening kind of omnivore or dinosaurs - like Triceratops and Brachiosaurus have been painted. The origin story for these pieces began when Nick first heard about dinosaurs having feathers.<br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2560px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2560px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/8f004691.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div><figcaption>‘Prehistoric’ in the MOR by Nick Ladd</figcaption></figure><p>‍<br></p><h3>On Studio Syro<br></h3><p>Currently, Nick Ladd works as a part of an artist collective that signs off as&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://studiosyro.com/">Studio Syro</a>. This is a collective of artists who have come together to explore the extents of Quill and VR as a creative medium. This collective has been working since early 2020 to collaboratively make VR and animated works that they believe could prove hard to scale as solo artists.&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>“We saw that we kind of required a team to come together. Before we officially became Studio Syro, we did a music video sometime in last Oct-Nov (2019) which sort of brought us together. And now, having taken on bigger projects together made us decide to incorporate ourselves into a company.”<br></blockquote><p>Nick, also one of the co-founders of this collective, has been busy with projects that have panned the form of short films, music videos and animated VR scenes and narratives. The group is motivated to push Quill into the foyer of the entertainment industry, and with that the industry itself in new directions. Working this way helps the team have a workflow figured out, preparing them to sign bigger projects as a collective, especially with working in Quill as a team being a new phenomenon.&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>“I’m still working largely as a Quill artist, but as Studio Syro we have been able to bag some ambitious development projects too. Like we took on some grad shows for a local school, we did a launch party for a recent film - that took place in VR as an event. So we’re taking the stuff we create in Quill, taking it into Unity to be able doing some interesting social experiments with the artwork. We do not want to be only known as a collective of Quill artists doing Quill animation as we plan on branching out and create stuff that people can interact with.”<br></blockquote><p>Some recent pieces from Studio Syro that can be experienced are episodes from the Soda Island series. The first episode is called&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrnKjhH5NHg">‘The Multiverse Bakery’</a>&nbsp;and the second one is called&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.oculus.com/vr/?id=3609570642388868">‘The Neon Jungle’</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Sometimes ambitions are larger than budgets, and that has been something Studio Syro is keen on getting past. Nick explained how a balance between getting a good budget and being able to deliver high quality innovation is something the collective tries to prioritize. A lot of the work that they’ve done already is pretty cutting edge. As most Quill projects are usually conceived by singular artists, Studio Syro’s eight-person team collaborating on pieces opens up the scope of experimentation, and points of discovery become abundant too with every decision.&nbsp;</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="padding-bottom:56.206088992974244%" data-rt-type="video" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="" data-rt-max-height="56.206088992974244%" data-rt-dimensions="854:480" data-page-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXYCr2pGTfw "><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KXYCr2pGTfw"></iframe></div></figure><p><br></p><p><em>Slushii - Dreaming of You/Far Away - Official Music Video by Studio Syro</em></p><p>‍</p><h3>On Artists &amp; Collaboration<br></h3><p>While creating his dinosaur series, Nick was inspired by the painter&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://jamesgurney.com/site/">James Gurney</a>, who is known for his own dinosaur pieces. One can see that some slivers of inspiration also come from the work of the artist&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.robhruppel.com/">Robh Ruppel</a>, who does graphic depictions of buildings and landscapes in a certain recognisable style.

As a lead artist who has kind of been instrumental in showing people Quill and getting people invested in the software, he has a fair following including those at Studio Syro.<br></p><blockquote>“I would love to work with either of the artists I just mentioned from the Quill Sphere. I think I'm working with a lot of my favorite artists right now at Studio Syro. I'm working with a fantastic team.”<br></blockquote><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:800px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="800px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/ezgifcom-gif-maker.gif" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div><figcaption>Joe Sparrow’s Tarot Deck translated in VR by Nick Ladd</figcaption></figure><p>‍<br></p><p>An artist named&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.joe-sparrow.com/">Joe Sparrow</a>&nbsp;is someone whose&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://joe-sparrow.tumblr.com/post/151790134098/the-tarot-major-arcana-illustrated-by-joe">tarot cards</a>&nbsp;Nick once translated to animated VR art. A studio that Nick told us about -&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://kurzgesagt.org/">Kurzgesagt</a>&nbsp;whose&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q">YouTube channel</a>&nbsp;is a whole trove of animated explainer videos. The nature of videos they make, with their educational documentary style, seem like another interesting VR direction that Nick is excited about.</p><p><br></p><h3>On Tools &amp; Translation<br></h3><p>Often, at Studio Syro, what comes with a brief is concept art painted in 2D, and it asks to be translated into VR. Looking at a piece of design work that's not meant to be 3D, and is styled in its own specific way, can be very interesting to reimagine for a three-dimensional world.&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>“I like to work with 2D artists as well as 3D artists, because I find that a lot of VR artists who only work in VR when they're designing things, they know the limitations of Quill, they know the limitations of VR art, so they might try to avoid painting something a certain way. But if you're taking it from a 2D concept that had no preconceived notion of ‘will this work will this not’, you usually end up with a much more creative final output that looks much more impressive than if you'd started entirely in VR - when working with artists who are new to it especially.”<br></blockquote><p>Nick has noticed how much of a difference there often is between the pieces that come from creative teams with a background in 3D animation - who maybe want to do their film in Maya and then move it into Unity and then release it as a VR piece - and pieces created by Quill artists.&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>“The stuff that's made in Quill has a different kind of energy to it, it feels and seems handmade. It can nearly feel like traditional media, even though it's not - and that's a very interesting spot for Quill work to be in. Taking pieces that were once 2D and turning them into a 360 film is probably like the easiest way to take a work that you've created somewhere else and bring it into VR.&nbsp;I think the stuff that's made directly in VR always has its own unique feel to it, that is more interesting than stuff that made traditional pipelines and then brought over.”</blockquote><h3>‍<br>Nick’s Advice on Monetization as a VR creator<br></h3><p>Being willing to look at VR as a new medium is important for artists early in their journey. It takes getting past some frustration and it isn’t as simple as taking what you may have done before in a digital medium and trying to retranslate it.&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>“I think compared to most mediums, VR is probably one of the easiest things you could learn. It takes the things you've done before and kind of remixes them a little bit. But for some people, that can be daunting. I sure think it's worth pushing through, to really get to a unique new style.”</blockquote><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:800px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="800px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/eastereggsreplaycut.gif" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div><figcaption>Nick Ladd near his work in the MOR, available as a Spatial Interview</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>Nick added how there are a few ways to figure out what you can capitalize on. In his case, he is able to create things much faster with his VR workflow. Using that he was able to find work in the market seeking stylized artwork, which has especially opened up with the advent of films like&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4Hbz2jLxvQ">Into the Spider Verse</a>. So one way to find clients could be to deliver on a stylized aesthetic with a quicker turnaround, as VR artists have a real edge over typical 3D artists, whose workflows can occasionally be slower and clunkier.<br></p><p><br></p><h4>Fun Fact<strong>‍</strong></h4><blockquote><strong>‍</strong>“I have a business card collection from all the events I’ve gone to and the people I've met, so I have over a thousand business cards that I like to keep in a binder. And they're so colorful and I just really enjoy them because they feel like they feel like a collection of everybody I've met throughout my career, in one place that I can look back on. And it's a nice little way to keep memories!”<br></blockquote><p>You can find Nick’s independent work at <a href="https://www.nickladd.tv/">nickladd.tv</a> or on <a href="https://sketchfab.com/Nicktheladd">Sketchfab</a>.

    content: `<p>To start off 2021, we invited sound designers&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/emaudible">Em Halberstadt</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/soundseeds">Millie Wissar</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ashellinthepit.com/">‘<em>A Shell in the Pit</em>’</a>&nbsp;to pick apart and unpeel the many layers of sound in VR. Here’s a wholesome revisit, or call them closely-taken notes, on the aspects of sound that our guest speakers unblurred.<br></p><p>As Em and Millie have teamed up on several sound projects in the past and have experience working on the sound of the MOR itself, the talks were made all the more fun as attendees toured some of the works that they spoke about. While the focus of what Em shared was the&nbsp;<strong>spatialization of sound</strong>&nbsp;by breaking sound down into components and talking about the use of references from story-elements, Millie elaborated on how&nbsp;<strong>Ambisonic Sound</strong>&nbsp;works.</p><p>‍</p><h3>EM HALBERSTADT on Spatializing Sound<br></h3><p>In VR, sound immerses you in the midst of the story of a space. Sound is inherently spatial. It creates a more complete sense of immersion than in the real world, as it envelopes you and lets you hear all the different layers of sound coming from a specific direction. There's a reason meditation techniques focus on sound so much, to bring about a sense of presence - as it surrounds you in a moment in time. It fits in with VR perfectly, where using it as a spatial element guides the audience through an experience with sound cues. When people hear something in the distance or behind them, they're naturally drawn towards it. So we are directing a gaze, or body movements subconsciously. This helps create a seamless experience of a story. </p><p>It is very important in VR, when you have an entire world around you, that you know where to look. Regardless of whether a piece of VR art is animated or static - sound adds movement, life and an element of time. This makes it a powerful tool for storytelling. When you design these little snippets of time, you allow them to be discovered throughout a space, really bringing a viewer into that world. It creates an experience that's interactive. And in VR, such interactions with the body are what create a feeling of being immersed. </p><p>Several ways of being creative with it were scattered throughout Em’s talk. She took us through examples where accomplishing different kinds of immersion was the ambition. Some different methods or elements sound designers use - and have been put to use throughout the museum, and in almost every art piece - were delved into.</p><p>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="padding-bottom:56.206088992974244%" data-rt-type="video" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="" data-rt-max-height="56.206088992974244%" data-rt-dimensions="854:480" data-page-url="https://youtu.be/39eS5ub1XSg"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/39eS5ub1XSg"></iframe></div></figure><p>‍<br></p><h4>Units of Spatial Sound<br></h4><p>The first kind of immersion is designed using&nbsp;<strong>ambient sound</strong>. So you can hear it, as it kind of surrounds you. Most of the sound you hear in the museum are elaborate ambiences. Every world created within the museum has what gets called a&nbsp;<strong>sound bed</strong>&nbsp;- which reflects on its environment. For&nbsp;<em>Alex's Sci-Fi World</em>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/artists/matt-schaefer">Matt Schaefer</a>, rain is the bed that grounds the viewer, and it's created using four&nbsp;<strong>mono files</strong>&nbsp;placed in your headset.&nbsp;<br></p><p>As the mono files are made to follow the camera with six relative positions (and they don't rotate with the camera), &nbsp;you can turn your head inside of the ambience. Next, there are&nbsp;<strong>spot ambiences</strong>&nbsp;and loops that are placed all around in the space for the viewer to discover. The spray painter in&nbsp;<em>Alex’s Sci-Fi World</em>&nbsp;is one example of a spot. As you get closer to such spots, the volume fades up - following what's called an&nbsp;<strong>attenuation curve</strong>. You can set the distance on these curves such that bigger sounds can be heard from further away and draw you in, and smaller sounds are more like secrets to discover. You won't hear them unless you come really close to engage and trigger it to unravel.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Such use of sound encourages people to explore more, as once they realize that they can find these sorts of instances their experience starts feeling playful. Spots work like little stories, as they are details that help give life and movement to a world. Like that little conversation between bugs in&nbsp;<em>Alex’s Sci-Fi World</em>. They can be uneventful, but could still work as entire sequences of conversations that ebb and flow in the space. Even if it's not a linear story - the feeling of life, and the emotion of the sound can be quite powerfully driven.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Perhaps the most distinctly separate element in sound design is&nbsp;<strong>music</strong>. In some cases, the music may be&nbsp;<strong>diegetic</strong>. This means that it is sound that lives within the world. A technique used to suggest this is known as&nbsp;<strong>futzing</strong>, which is the process of making sound seem like it's coming from a radio, a phone - which in the scene Em shared (during the talk) was used to design the sound for a band. Em recommended that music is made diegetic in VR, so that there is the option to move away from it. While music with no source can take you out of the feeling of an environment, it can also compensate its presence by carrying an emotion. It's when non-diegetic music is overused, that an overloaded numbness gets caused - which could be unpleasant. Unless it's made more atmospheric - like an ambience. The ambience in the lobbies of the MOR is a bit of a cross between music and ambience, for example. There’s a mix of scatter sounds (which are non-looping sounds, triggered at random locations in time) and ambient sounds. Sounds of birds, gusts of winds or other environmental sounds are another example of ambience which add a sense of space that's alive. Such a suggestion of life can be deteriorated if sounds are looped - because life is random and doesn't loop.<br></p><p>Em shared&nbsp;<em>Skeletons</em>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/artists/liz-edwards">Liz Edwards</a>&nbsp;to give another example of a spot. A spot can be heard from further away to drag the viewer towards the source. The cackles and laughs in this piece are an example of what are called&nbsp;<strong>SFX</strong>&nbsp;(short for sound effects). Sound effects are interactive sounds - which in VR one can find many ways to get creative with as much as in non-VR. In the case of the piece in question, the movement of the body through the door gets used as a cue that triggers a big laugh and draws the viewer towards the spot.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The direction of the viewer’s gaze can also be used as a trigger in VR. When you look at each of the skeletons, a randomly selected laugh gets triggered. It's less conventional than having the sound direct the gaze, but that makes things real fun. This was a deliberate choice for the piece, to not let viewers realize what's happening. Yet the sound gives this feeling that the skeletons are aware of what the viewers are doing. This brings them to life as they are as active as the viewers are in a transactional gaze. Creating the story using the body of the viewer can be powerful. This can also be seen in another piece by Liz called&nbsp;<em>Ghouls</em>. In this case, the sculpture is brought to life with literal breathing that follows the animation in the piece. However, this doesn’t mean that sound effects need movement or animation of their own to generate a sound. The effect could be used to encourage a viewer to move closer to the characters or properties in the artwork. The bed ambience in this piece brings you in to feel an aura of creepiness.</p><p>‍</p><h4>How to communicate abstract ideas about Sound<br></h4><p>We often hear people saying they don't know how to talk about sound, they struggle to describe it. If you're wanting to communicate with a sound designer and help them understand the story you want to tell using sound, the following is some language-level advice that could help.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Experimenting with making sound yourself helps as a starting point. It is often hard to find words for the sound qualities you are wishful for - but you could try to ask the following questions:&nbsp;<br></p><p>-<em>How do you want people to feel when experiencing your piece?&nbsp;</em></p><p>The range can be broad, but you can begin mapping it out. Are you looking for something that feels positive, dark, moody, sad, or relaxed? Pretty much any emotion you can think of is a great piece of direction.&nbsp;<br></p><p>-<em>What kind of design?</em></p><p>When speaking of design, the sound could be (for example) organic by design. By which you could suggest that the sound is grounded, or based on natural elements like water, fire, earth, wind, glass, metal, or wood. A contrary could be synthetic sound - for which there may be a synthesis of sounds. Such sound is often created for sci-fi textures.<br></p><p>For something more high tech, texture can be created by manipulating sound waves. In terms of language around the sound itself, different frequencies of the same sound can communicate different feelings. Lower frequencies can be calming, while very high frequencies can be unnerving. It’s common, but may not always be the case. It can be considered useful though while mapping out experiments.&nbsp;<br></p><p><em>-References are always great!</em></p><p>Provide your sound designer with some references. There could be vocal examples. Try making the sound using your voice. This may feel silly but it's very legitimate to use your voice to suggest your sound design requirements. The entire ambience, the bass of the museum, is in fact made using just Em’s breathing!&nbsp;<br></p><p><em>-Learn the names of some simple effects</em></p><p>Several sorts of effects exist and are spoken of colloquially. Learning their names is a quick trick of the trade. Like ‘reverb’ or ‘delay’ - which often translate sound into magical or otherworldly effects.&nbsp;<br></p><p>-<em>Descriptors or Textures</em></p><p>Using some descriptors like ethereal, floaty, tactile, realistic, grounded, crunchy, aggressive, impactful, or subtle could give your sound designer some context. You can also use words that convey emotional tone, so as to describe the sound you’re seeking.</p><p><br></p><p>---</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1440px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1440px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/b27c99f7-7da7-48d1-8f58-3e4c7f48dfe7-copy.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div><figcaption>Em and Millie on a tour with attendees by the <em>Immateria </em>exhibit</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>Em spoke about&nbsp;<em>Immateria</em>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/artists/isaac-cohen">Cabibbo</a>, which serves as an example of adding sound to something abstract. The piece is so texturally rich and outlandish, that it could be made to sound like anything. For Em the starting point was tone - and what the piece makes her feel.&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>“I almost always start my design with organic sounds. So I recorded a bunch of weird stuff with some chimes and a banjo. To make it sound otherworldly. I reverse a lot of the sound out of a ton of reverb and effects. These are just looping sounds, but what you can't hear in this video is that the piece is reacting to a voice which could be both premises. But there are always technical restraints with experimental art and we weren't able to get the sound tied to that reaction. So I tried to design this with as much movement as possible.”&nbsp;<br></blockquote><p>Therefore, a sound designer thinking spatially thinks about the experience of hearing what is in front of&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;behind you. Sound positioned, as such, is known as a&nbsp;<strong>scatter sound</strong>. The sounds in Cabibbo’s piece randomly sweep in, to and fro, in all directions. There are multiple spots on the string piece, which amplify the same sound as the viewer moves. It's made to be narrow so that you can kind of follow it along. And while all these seemingly separate pieces are combined into one installation, making use of similar source material - they're manipulated and recorded in different ways to capture various movements (while remaining cohesive). Wherever possible, Em has added spaces that let the viewer discover the feeling of difference as they get entered. The cubes in the piece are where Em wanted to bring in a cozy feeling, which closes in as a contrast to the open space of the rest of the piece. There are instances of spot sounds that communicate movement, like a stream of bubbles. The viewer can float around in the bubbles, and can also hear them as you approach them - which makes you enter their stream and start floating with them.<br></p><p>A piece that Em created the art and the sound for, called&nbsp;<em>Capsule</em>&nbsp;is an example of another application of sound for VR, that opens up the conversation of recording techniques. She made use of<strong>&nbsp;binaural microphones</strong>&nbsp;for this piece. These microphones record sound relative to where the microphone is, or the listener is by going into each ear. As they are designed to record how humans hear, they take the human head into account.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Em’s piece&nbsp;<em>Capsule&nbsp;</em>really makes a case for how these microphones are at capturing the essence of a memory, because it sounds like you're listening through someone else's perspective. As the slivers of stories held by&nbsp;<em>Capsule</em>&nbsp;are fleeting and fragmented - like in a memory casket - they embrace the listener in a manner that makes you tune into a shard of recorded time. Em adds that these may not always be suited for VR. But as&nbsp;<em>Capsule&nbsp;</em>was created gesturally to suggest that the bubbles in the sculpture are spaces for listening, the spatial aspects of the piece come together because of a decision to stop and let the memories take a sonic hold.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><h3>MILLIE WISSAR on Ambisonic Sound<br></h3><p>Ambisonics is a technology that was created back in the 1970s, yet there was never a commercial use for it. That being until VR and 360 videos came along - which as formats in themselves require 360° audio. The basic approach of ambisonics is to treat an audio scene as a full 360° sphere of sound coming from different directions towards a center point. This also includes locating sound sources that are above or below the listeners ear-level. To be able to listen to ambisonics, the listener/sound designer needs a decoder. The decoder that Millie Wissar uses is called&nbsp;<em>Dear VR Pro</em>,&nbsp;<em>Ambi Micro</em>. The MOR has a decoder of its own too, which is why listening to ambisonics inside the museum with headphones is made possible.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="padding-bottom:56.206088992974244%" data-rt-type="video" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="" data-rt-max-height="56.206088992974244%" data-rt-dimensions="854:480" data-page-url="https://youtu.be/OT5uNL7Lt-g"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OT5uNL7Lt-g"></iframe></div></figure><p>‍</p><p>Millie worked on bringing the sound of the film&nbsp;<em>How Was Your Day</em>&nbsp;into the MOR for the show in November 2020 titled&nbsp;<em>Body Clock</em>. The short film by&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/artists/edward-madojemu">Edward Madojemu</a>&nbsp;is a 360° sci-fi animation, which requires 360° sound. Millie had been wanting to work on ambisonics for a while, and she shared how this project was a great way for her to learn ambisonics and immersive storytelling. Despite being worked on in this manner, Ambisonic sounds feel and sound way more natural than sound in the real world. This, she explained, is because of how when we step into the real world, we are surrounded by ambiences that keep us in their hold even if we look away.<br></p><blockquote>“The work begins with ambience in the scene. The footsteps of the characters running, the robot jumping, the machines moving. The ambiences are able to glue all the smaller sound effects together. They also tell you where you are, and set the mood. They give you information about the location. You could be looking anywhere, but the ambiences will stay enveloped around you.”&nbsp;<br></blockquote><p>Well-designed ambiences can essentially form a detailed narrative about the scene independently. The plugin used for putting together the sounds for&nbsp;<em>How Was Your Day</em>&nbsp;is called&nbsp;<em>Dear VR Pro,&nbsp;</em>alongside Reaper, which is a software Millie uses to edit sound. Once the sounds felt ready, she put all the render files with the video player back in Virtual Desktop. It was important to reference in VR and not using a flat screen, to be able to tell the distances of the objects moving in space. You need to be in VR to reference VR! Following some research, she found that this setup would be ideal when working with visual cues and if ‘mixing’ is involved. Mixing is when sound designers move sounds around according to what can be seen in the picture and then balancing the sounds together so that they make sense in the story. Another tool that can be useful (that Millie mentions in the talk) is called&nbsp;<em>Dear VR</em>&nbsp;<em>Spatial Connect</em>. While she didn’t make use of it, she shared what it can do for a similar scenario involving mixing. It is designed to connect your headset to your editing software. So, one would still need to have&nbsp;<em>Dear VR Pro</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Dear VR Micro</em>&nbsp;to be able to listen to the ambisonic files binaurally and to be able to pan the objects in 360°.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Millie shared a scene from Madojemu’s film where there is a crash, to show how she applied her research about these tools. While the scene visually omits the actual crash (with a black screen) and transitions to a frame where the characters end up after the crash, this scene is important for how it closes the circular narrative. The fact that in this scene, there was no given visual cue to follow, it gave Millie an opportunity to creatively play around with&nbsp;<em>Dear VR Pro</em>. She took sounds of the crash and moved them around ‘the head’ of the listener using this tool. She did this a bunch of times, recorded the results, and then applied the one that made the closest sense to the story and the details in the scene.<br></p><p>What is important to note is that when it comes to sound in an immersed narrative, the experience cannot be keyed as ‘watching’ a piece. The viewer is ‘entering an experience’ and ambisonics sound is capable of enhancing that feeling of entering and being enveloped. Millie confirmed, in conclusion, how all of this theory actually works.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The advice from both our guest speakers privileges playing with sound through immersed observation. Using some of these techniques and tools could surely serve as a technical starting point, but step zero (applicable irrespective of VR) is the resolve around becoming an effective communicator, developing awareness around the referential feelings that can conjure and amalgamate in space for a listener to brush shoulders with.</p><p>‍</p>`

    content: `<p><em>Let’s Get Real</em>&nbsp;was the MOR’s first-of-a-kind talk event where we were able to bring two <em>trailblazers</em> in a room together to pendulate a new amplitude for understanding VR’s history, and projected future. Our guest speakers Jackie Morie (@skydeas1) and John Orion Young (@JohnOrionYoung) were able to engage those in attendance with far-reaching, infinity-pool immersed perspectives from both their real and virtual investments in art-making.<br></p><p>We decided to document their talks in near-entirety, to be able to allow everyone an opportunity to revisit the spectacle that their combined energy happened to be. Here’s what we learnt on November 25th, 2020.<br>‍</p><h3>JACKI MORIE :&nbsp;<em>When Pixels were Precious</em><br></h3><p>Jacki Morie received a Masters of Fine Arts and a Masters in Computer Science from the University of Florida in 1988, and her PhD in immersive environments at the University of East London in 2008. As a result of advancing in this field and her years of studies, she founded (at the University of Southern California) the&nbsp;<em>Institute for Creative Technologie</em>s in 1999, and has gone on to start her own company,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://alltheseworldsllc.com/"><em>All These Worlds</em>&nbsp;</a>where she continues to build social-virtual worlds and immersive environments.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>Jacki took us to the “ancient days of VR”, as she puts it. Her presentation captured a fair bit, painting a picture about what it was like in the late 1980s and the early 1990s - when VR got its second wave.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:800px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="800px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/ubkbjaeepngpxbszrzcjo6a2_gnyvuybbdqpa7hkv-5b00fxypifghg9veew8ymya7zi_yfd2ytxhpvabl3vd0w863fpzl2-n4hfbftvw3er2aessv3i5gpdokckriesf0rgxsyt.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div><figcaption>The VR Scene, 1991</figcaption></figure><blockquote><em>“The gear was huge, expensive and no individuals could afford it. You either go to your University research lab to buy it for research purposes, or you put down a lot of money to get into what I’m standing in.”&nbsp;</em><br></blockquote><p>Back in that time, few companies had the tech, generally deep inside of research divisions where VR was of interest, largely for architecture or architectural design. A more notable success story from back then was NASA, as they were using VR for teleoperations - to be able to operate space stations from a distance. With how it goes with research, few companies sprung up to supply the needs such as that of NASA and a handful of other companies. Given this early context, it isn’t surprising that there was no VR artwork per say. Whatever did go on or did get conceived was being gleaned for the practical. A few determined artists, such as Jacki, did figure out how to get into the research labs. There were a couple of programs in Europe and in Canada - there was even one at the Banff New Media Institute (BNMI) where they were able to secure funds and equipment for programmers and new media artists. In essence, during the years 1992-94, there were individuals making use of early tech to create VR art.&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote><em>“I went the way of worming my way into a research lab. We worked on a project called&nbsp;‘Virtopia’&nbsp;after hours - a personal art project. In the daytime, we did research assignments for places like the Army Research Institute - who wanted to know if you were legally blind in the headsets of the day - which yes, you were. We put eye-charts in there and you couldn’t really read them. But after hours we were able to use all that very expensive equipment that the research lab bought, to do our own thing.”&nbsp;</em></blockquote><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1313px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1313px"><div><img alt="A picture containing indoor, room, sitting, lookingDescription automatically generated" src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/rgrcub9xqm9-rkalq4pvkeoklkfdeacxtgxgzhg1sycooqpaduob3ddbyyhb6zdrgnypzfn3fxswgs9nwmo5bm-y2sm4ntjszc8hhplhttaimf3sqp32wrayk60xtddia7m8m4z.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:886px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="886px"><div><img alt="vrspider.png" src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/qcq8ovzosv6it0plvqn4y6xmoxa5084phb_gwvdnjfatdlwaufzp9qxnvnfarl0exjh_dud0fcxr3l0tvnb7av6n94zzyjgjyechtjao5ve7qliqsxisl4hvgq3ib10xgetj8h_h.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:528px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="528px"><div><img alt="Guest2.png" src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/f3dbmm8hjjuqx9wonjs_9pjexbjnuhjy8tgz46lhbuoyfq0wq0cn4mokqourmrsgwr_uksznlm_-i0-kranh170y8ocy3rwtwibf-cxbzrrauw5ieszkxow4okiorcdajpz7yytk.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div><figcaption>‘Virtopia’ and the spider fear entrainment</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p><em>‘Virtopia’</em>&nbsp;was Jacki’s first VR artwork which was designed as a series of digital environments, such that each one was designed to elicit different kinds of emotional responses. There was very little emotion in VR back then, but much interest in experimenting with it.&nbsp;<em>‘Virtopia’</em>&nbsp;was the home, for example, to a 30-foot tall spider that had a really interesting part to its body programming. So, if you ignored it, it would ignore you back - and you’d simply hear a spatialized heartbeat slowly. But if it saw you and got interested in coming after you, that heartbeat went really, really fast. And that being so fast, it would entrain your heartbeat with that. When this was shown at the Florida Film Festival - the first-ever festival to include VR art - viewers were really thrown off by the experience, with some viewers even ripping off the headset and fleeing.<br></p><p>There were a number of different environments subsumed within&nbsp;<em>Virtopia</em>. Artist Mike Goslin, who went on to do a range of VR work,&nbsp;<em>imagineered</em>&nbsp;some of the very abstract and very artistic environments for&nbsp;<em>Virtopia</em>&nbsp;with Jacki. The work Jacki spoke of had an invested interest in spatial sound, sense of space, and the body’s surroundedness as feelings. One work had a kind of a crowd sound as if there were people there. In another, there was a photo album on the table and every photo had a snippet of conversation that you could actually listen to.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Jacki has notably helped in the founding of University of Southern California’s Institute for Creative Technologies, in 1999. When she started working there, she created a project that looked at how one could expand the sensory inputs for virtual reality. And this meant expanding almost all of the emotional vocabulary. ‘Dark Con’, which took several years, was where she built a fully spatialized sound setup with speakers instead of headsets, an infrasonic floor which allowed playing sounds back between 400-420 hertz - which you couldn’t really hear but your body felt.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><em>“It really helped up the emotional ante of the environments we were creating. We even added scent, by creating in 2004 a scent collar to be able to put scents in virtual reality. And that was really successful - as before that, you could put scents in VR but it would require these huge devices and it would stink up the room and you’d have to get special equipment to get that smell out of the room.”</em></blockquote><p>The scent collar that they came up with was more localized in its function, as it just put the scents very near your neck and it didn’t spray it. It used something called molecular drip to dissipate the odour molecules near the nose.<br><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:288px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="288px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/l7z2qtnrfy5zeqfagb7tkdxjr4oecukoiuaugdeef9mkyspzcabxw1vnwqctnsyt46vkumimcvlflsa41x6saj8wx3jpsf53qlgvcfdcg4en_vi_2iep1l37x31eh28p9z3aqa1z.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:384px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="384px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/lbhagnda6kfszglrhvcjo6v4o5ihkaasiy4a1j8wrld_ha_fmiucmwrl3p-w-epjk_la6ji3rf_dy7hb_yvem8v_j7nrxqlr5oufuo4xsbb2gfbhgbcqg6asyhi9rlngcyx42hqd.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div><figcaption>Scent Release Necklace design sketch and prototype.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>Jacki was an artist before there were computer graphics. In 1981 when she was able to buy an Apple II computer, it had a whopping 280x192 pixels to work with. For her Master’s Thesis (1981-84), she drew things onto this Apple II computer using a graphics tablet, basically a bunch of magnetic wires which weighed about 30 pounds and was fairly expensive.

John, who grew up in Colorado, looked up to his father - a wildlife artist - as he bronze-casted and oil-painted animals. This became John’s early concept of art through a traditional lens for all aspirational purposes.</p><p>When a friend of JOY’s showed him a Salvador Dali book, he naturally reconfigured and reoriented himself. At this point in time he became extremely invested in painting. After finishing high school and throughout, plus much after his college years - he reports having produced thousands of paintings of varying scales and on all sorts of surfaces.</p><blockquote><em>“I first did little canvases, then doors, and I was basically painting constantly. I was just trying to find any surface to paint on. But I kind of started to feel real weird about the environmental impact of making so much stuff. But I just wanted to be making things and so I was experimenting with things like painting with water, like on concrete, and just photographing little explorations. But it wasn’t what I wanted to be. I wanted to make everything from nothing.”</em></blockquote><p>It was after seeing a giant spider being sculpted in VR, that prompted JOY to buy his first headset and build himself a tiny PC with some minimum specs, and get started with making his own stuff. He wanted to work with clay and volume, and that was about when Oculus came up with touch controllers with sculpting in Medium. He decided to do what art education is known to steer you away from - making smiley faces and making peace signs and ying-yangs. But that was what he began with and found a whole bunch of symbolic joy through, by producing them in VR.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1600px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1600px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/f7k5jtca3qfrc19fxbra8q-_gavinuigevst2laeuvgrttv1f6dvykj224ooq0gzwigjww8h9yeg7we6vkwsumvykf3btewempb5wn9t9eaarxa1ctfnfyukhwil4gpahazo55g5.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div><figcaption>JOYs evolved from Young’s rebellious, joyous decision to make smiley faces.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>Jump to 2016 - and picture JOY just spinning stuff up in VR air. He got into creating different characters through 2016 and 2017. Crypto Kitties came out then, having invented a way to buy digital cats and breed them. Furthermore, they could be sold and traded on the Ethereum blockchain. When JOY saw this, he thought how this amazing approach is perhaps the first way that we can have decentralized, global computing that is not controlled by any centralized entity. Everyone could essentially put their artworks up and trade them without an institution. But this was before platforms for trading art were conceived.</p><p>JOY decided to study the Crypto Kitties contract himself, as it was open-source and anybody was allowed to copy it. He took a bunch of courses online to learn how to program what then became the first JOY art market. As JOYs are basically each a virtual muse that ‘gives you a magic power once it is inside your wallet’, each JOY can only be owned by one person at a time. </p><blockquote><em>“What I did with my contract was that I removed the part that allowed true ownership, and so if you’re willing to pay more than the last person paid, you could steal their JOY. So that’s why each JOY had a next price on it. The current price was 0.632 for ‘Overcome the World’, but if you bought it the price would automatically go up to 0.815 which was about $1000 at the time. And so with that idea, you could steal someone’s JOY and you could never have true ownership - and there was a lot of fun with it, so 81 original JOYs ended up trading about some 1440 times which is more than any other body of artworks that has been traded.”</em><br></blockquote><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1600px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1600px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/hffivsanrfaxsrejrrublo6ku0qy7lf2cyo1c1tayfgxja8po_hocwq22oqavejwdabrrm67kukesl1lopgsidxiadzd14hiw4nexlm2sihbrf0w5bw0yuh0rkhj_42e5aws67b_.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div><figcaption>The ‘About Page’ for the JOY ‘Monster Whale’.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>Each JOY from JOY World has its own ‘About’ page and unique magical power. A ‘Monster Whale’, for instance, has the ability to enable its owner ‘to roll through any obstacle on the adventure of their dreams’. Now, if Jimmy owns it, he can choose to just send it to a friend or list it for a higher or a lower price. This, in essence, is true ownership - and JOY collectors have taken these concepts forward in their own ways. One of the collectors who owns ‘Whale Shark’ has built his a coin on top of the JOY. So with his own money and all the other NFTs collected - he has accrued millions of dollars of NFTs and then built a currency. Another case in point is a person who took their JOY and shattered it into a million pieces, such that if you buy all those pieces, and collect them, only then can you put the JOY back together.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1600px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1600px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/sgvc3yc0xqma6kcnpxsrpuk-h9ele3goboyldag5row5op1dxkvaul3qoohzbr_7bvrnpteowo_pgq1hiflenk9a_kyzffztr8olxtwip1i68jpckak2zqun56klojichk4m7b3t.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div><figcaption>The Trading History of the JOY Donk.</figcaption></figure><blockquote>“I really try to think everyday about the conversation of art and where I’m adding my voice to it, and I like to think of Warhol’s obsession with commerce and multiples. And then even Takashi Murakami built on top of that with the idea of how everyone wants to have toys and every level of accessory from bubble gum, and all the way up to one-on-one sculptures and paintings. So this to me is a very fascinating side of art, that we kind of don’t talk a lot about but it is so fun and important that - when you make something, you’ve created an asset; you have taken your energy and your energy is an asset. And that then becomes like a tradable thing. So here we have the price history of the JOY art market. And you can see how it changes over time.”</blockquote><p>At different times, all of the JOYs collectively have been worth over a million dollars depending on what is being traded and at what rate. So it’s amazing and kind of strange that as artists we try not to think about things this way, but it is always going on, and you can see on the far right (table image) - this is just the trading history of one JOY, over time - so you can see when somebody has made an offer, and then somebody else has accepted the offer, and they then sold it and transferred it. But what we have here is a gigantic, public ledger of artwork - when it was created, who owned it, how much they paid for it, and then how much the next person had to. This is the first time in history that there are public ledgers of everything being created and where it is going.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="padding-bottom:56.206088992974244%" data-rt-type="video" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="" data-rt-max-height="56.206088992974244%" data-rt-dimensions="854:480" data-page-url="https://youtu.be/YodsKy8zQTE"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YodsKy8zQTE"></iframe></div></figure><p>‍</p><h3>New Flexes in Art Creation, Collection, and Ownership</h3><p>When thinking about the long-term in such programmability of money and art (that John has so expertly explained) the economics of action figure collection may come to mind. With similarly projected bumps in value onto what figuratively begins with plastic toys, an aspect of collection and trading is what takes the transactional value of the art to obscene extremes. Sellers and buyers ascertain not the market price but ‘value’ (a good chunk of which may just be nostalgic) based on their own affordances. These figures too, in a few ways like JOYs, rely on extensive narrative (comics, movies) before becoming objects worth affection and ownership. In a larger discussion about price v/s value in media and popular culture, there’s generally 1000x reproduction (and you can pay a price to touch and hold your figurine) or owners earn revenue from ticketing viewers and charging them by the eyeball. With what JOY creates, there’s an interplay to make note of, plus an added advantage of these virtual characters never quite having to bear damage or become dated. They may be intangible but aren’t they indestructible? While JOY has had to redraw contracts in the last few years itself, the question is what might happen when the file types that these JOYs inhabit evolve? And what, when Ethereum grows beastlier new limbs? </p><p>The confluence of our two guest speakers was unendingly intriguing, as these sorts of redundancies were exactly what Jacki’s art has had to bear the brunt of. A lot of the artwork she created is inaccessible and uninhabitable purely because of file formats having evolved into completely new species. So there’s that furthermore conversation too, about the ownership of technological tools, and how those govern what digital assets can be created and sustained in the contemporary art world. </p><p>Over and above the ways in which these two artists have earned their living through artmaking, they’re also both rigorous researchers going above and beyond what is a given. We celebrate how they’ve both taken stakes in the future (doesn’t come sans risk) and not quite adhered to known formulas by any measure.</p>`

VR Art Live is best known for how anyone interested in the XR art industry is welcome to join their discord community. By holding events, challenges, and shows throughout the year on various VR platforms -- a kind of fever to stay creative is maintained. The artists share their work, find feedback, and work on improving and expanding their skills in parallel, making up for the dynamic energy in their highly engaged channels.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="padding-bottom:56.206088992974244%" data-rt-type="video" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="" data-rt-max-height="56.206088992974244%" data-rt-dimensions="854:480" data-page-url="https://youtu.be/0KcCoPu3qDY"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0KcCoPu3qDY"></iframe></div></figure><p>Music: <em>A Whisper</em> by Ann Annie. Sourced from the YouTube audio library.<br>‍</p><h4><strong>Sabby Lighf @TheSabbyLife&nbsp;</strong></h4><h6>California</h6><p><br></p><p>Sabby Lighf, the founder of <em>VR Art Live</em> and also a well-followed community leader, is someone with an active belief in wanting to share from all points in her learning curve. Sabby tells us how she founded the community in response to a need she felt, as a self-taught artist making sense of the XR industry. Her 365 Day Project concluded recently, and it made way for challenges becoming a key part of the community philosophy and a form of daily engagement. Artists take on the challenge to make new works of art daily, weekly, or monthly with a commitment. <em>“The very social nature of the VR Art Live community is what makes it so active, as even when we’re not creating art we’re all just hanging out and talking about it!”</em>.</p><p><br></p><h4><strong>ReVerse Butcher @reversebutcher</strong></h4><h6>Melbourne, Australia</h6><p><br></p><p>Reverse Butcher is a multi-disciplinary artist working across traditional and digital art &amp; active in the Live Performance scene with some incredible linework and what someone old school could call stage presence. <em>“In 2019 when I started experimenting with VR art, I drifted towards live-streaming. I connected with Sabby Light on Twitch, and started streaming myself solidly for about 6 months in 2019. I found that streaming live to the VRALive Discord group was a much better fit for me.”</em><br></p><p>Reverse Butcher also shared details about The VRBurn (&amp; REBurn) event that the VR Art Live community put on in <em>The Wave</em> in December 2019 - which proved to be a transformative experience. <em>“It was so freeing to see structures that would have been impossible for me to build IRL. To literally rise out of the ground and fly into the sky. To make spatial poems that shattered language and the laws of physics, and that couldn’t exist in any other artform OTHER than VR - in a live VR rave.”</em></p><p><br></p><h4><strong>Dan McGarry @bioptix_xr</strong></h4><h6>Berlin, Germany</h6><p><br></p><p><em>“At the end of 2018 I took part in a VR Art competition in Berlin led by XR artist Miguelangelo Rosario. His aim was to inspire and teach other artists about VR and AR tools so that they would adopt this exciting new medium. Through his personal workshops I learnt how to use Gravity Sketch, Tilt Brush and ARize.” </em>In a surprise announcement at the end of this event every participant received an Oculus Quest. Bioptix_XR considers this to have been an enabling starting point and the beginning of their journey as an XR artist.<br></p><p>Through social media Dan heard about Sabby putting on the VR Burn festival in Wave XR and decided to submit a Tilt Brush artworks for consideration. The work was accepted and like that Bioptix_XR was welcomed by the WaveXR and VR Art Live Communities. <em>“Everyone works together to motivate each other, to share knowledge about this new medium, and to take part in community challenges, which bring the artists even closer together. I am currently working on my 14th weekly submission for the 'Year of VR art' challenge.”&nbsp;</em></p><p><br></p><h4><strong>Oliver Kretschmer @Paperpyro</strong></h4><h6>Munich, Germany</h6><p><br></p><p>Paperpyro is a big fan of the work that the artists at <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en">Riot Games</a> have been creating. The VR drawings that were shared for this piece are meant as a form of tribute to them. While Paperpyro is not taking part in the ongoing VRA Live challenges, the engagement of community leaders has been a major draw. <em>“The community is very nice and supportive. I especially love how much engagement the community leaders show in the Discord server.”</em>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h4><strong>Dongsuk Lee @Suk_VR_Art</strong></h4><h6>Republic of Korea</h6><p><br></p><p>Suk_VR_Art</p><p><em>“I have been working every day in the 'Daily' section since January 1, 2020</em>. <em>I think it is a friendly and easily accessible community for people who want to do VR ART. And the management is really active and global.”</em> The work Suk_VR_Art shared with us is a scene where a young deer comes to drink water, quietly in the woods. The work was created using Tilt Brush and can also be experienced with a sound component.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Suk_VR_Art has a style with a reminiscent quality, taking you to places and scenes from stories and fables.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>Learn more about VRA&nbsp;Live on their <a href="https://www.vrartlive.org/">website</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/VRArtLive1">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/vrartlive/">Instagram</a>, and <a href="https://discord.com/invite/MdvYFzn">Discord</a>.<br></p>`

    title: "Spotlight: Isaac Cohen and the Telescope for the Mind",
    date: "May 27, 2020",
    image: "/images/blog/spotlight-isaac-cohen-and-the-telescope-for-the-mind.jpg",
    content: `<p>Often using the moniker ‘Cabbibo’ - a homage to the late physicist Nicola Cabibbo-- Isaac Cohen has been making art with computers for over ten years now. He studied Physics and Religious Studies after which he (naturally) found himself designing websites for friends. Soon after, he discovered 3DS (a 3D programming tool), and “ things started going crazy”.&nbsp;Since then, Cohen has published an eclectic array of works ranging from audiovisual fact-learning apps, interactive experiences made from recursive algorithms to a real-time procedural music blog where users traverse a universe of sound.<br></p><blockquote><em>“I don’t think I specifically chose Physics to help me do art, it was much more a case of - my parents wanted me to get a real job. And Religious Studies was something I wanted to do because I was interested in Spirituality and Philosophy. These departments at my school were really interesting, so we were studying everything from Nietzsche to Buddhism.”</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></blockquote><p>He just moved out to the coast of California to a town called Point Arena. Living close to the beach allows him to spend lots of time outside, which he says is an important part of his workflow.</p><blockquote><em>“I like to think about how making artwork can be similar to how crystals form. You have a supersaturated fluid, but you also have to have everything else be there. And at some point in time, there’s an anomaly that a crystal forms around. You don’t really get to pick when that anomaly enters that supersaturated fluid. But you can, sort of, prepare the fluid for when that moment occurs.”</em><br></blockquote><p>We asked Cohen about his first VR experience, and he shared with us about his time at Leap Motion. He had been invited into the Engineering Department and was in the company of some people he greatly respected. He recalls just staring at his hands and at the world around himself, and how moving it was. “I was really scared because I didn’t want to take off the headset for the people in the room I wanted to impress. I think I pretended to stay in there for a while. But yeah, I remember feeling like - oh my god, the future is so much more interesting with this ability to understand it.”<br></p><p>For Cohen, Math is the ultimate tool. He advises artists to invest in being mathematically sound. A lot can be unraveled from the base assumption that ‘1=1’ as a mathematical and realistic point of departure. It serves as the basis and allows any kind of creator to have a scaffolding that can later evolve into a magical, organic world. Cohen is a programmer, so for him, Sublime Text is an ally.<br></p><blockquote><em>“A lot of my artistic processes are centred almost exclusively around the concept of using compute shaders. It’s a way in which I use the GPU on a computer. The GPU allows for much faster computation because it is paralleliz-able. Which means that my instructions have to be made paralleliz-able. I have been building this engine to help me do some of this for quite a long time. The fun thing about this engine is that it can take things that are inside that world and then link them to each other really easily.”&nbsp;</em><br></blockquote><p>So if Cohen decided that he wanted to load a gooey mesh into a world he’s building, he can use that data to later do other things -- like put a bunch of hairs. Then using the tips of the hairs, a bunch of dandelions could be attached. Taking these big chunks and then linking them together starts being the thing that drives Cohen’s unique artistic expression. This linking of elements together allows for broad narrative juxtapositions and contrast - visually, philosophically, and story-wise.&nbsp;<br> </p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1366px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1366px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/morimmateria-v2-1366x768.png"></div><figcaption>Visitors exploring <a href="/artwork/immateria">Immateria</a> (2020) by Isaac Cohen</figcaption></figure><p>For&nbsp;<a href="/artwork/immateria" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Immateria</a>, Cohen's exhibit in the MOR, he worked through each element individually. He describes his computational process as making meaning actively through linkages and relationships between the elements. After each element has an identity of some sort, he begins to design interactions between them.<br></p><blockquote><em>“That’s where for me the real complexity is -- computationally, code-wise, architecture wise. But that’s also when to me things start feeling luscious. And that lusciousness is the big thing that I have been going for.”</em><br></blockquote><p>We also spoke about the future of VR as a medium, the hardware et al. Cohen feels strongly about how some frustrating practicalities that can limit a VR experience - an obvious one being comfort. Having a headset on your face can get annoying and uncomfortable, and then sweat can come and make things worse. One of the ways in which Cohen wants to think about it is such that something liberating doesn’t suddenly feel limited. VR tech ought to seek out practical ways, such that the strength of a VR experience or story gets served, allowing people to be able to tear up in VR without the experience getting ruined immediately.&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote><em>“From a sort of larger perspective, computers are described like bicycles for the mind. And I think&nbsp;VR works like a telescope for the mind. It can take a thing that is far away and not at human scale and sort of transport it and make it at human scale. So I like how it can be used to do things that are impossible or things that you do not get to do in any other medium. These things are the most liberating for me. Like flipping gravity, using impossible colours [and] doing impossible shapes.”</em><br></blockquote><p>Another larger narrative piece he shared the concept of was one where his love for computers is at the forefront. A scientist gets trapped inside of a computer and starts to discover life forms that live inside the computer. She begins to explore these worlds and gains an understanding of loneliness, connection, the concept of epiphany among other fun, spiritual emotions.&nbsp;“Stylistically I wanted to go along a vein where the computer is a mystical object. Our tendency with computation is to see a computer as a rigid, structured piece of technology. And that comes in the way of it being considered as a tool for self-expression. Perhaps, messy self-expression?”&nbsp;<br></p><div data-rt-embed-type='true'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The first one I wanna talk about is a NEW DONUT! <a href="https://t.co/WhIG4cwWO1">https://t.co/WhIG4cwWO1</a> <a href="https://t.co/gZMXnteuVt">pic.twitter.com/gZMXnteuVt</a></p>&mdash; cabbibo (@Cabbibo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cabbibo/status/1233132650967126016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p><em>Cohen tweets about the process behind one of his pieces in the MOR</em></p><p>Finally, we touched upon music and sound design -- given how much they are integral to Cohen’s work. He told us how he grew up playing a lot of instruments and still happens to make a lot of music. Sound being so present in his life makes it come into play quite organically.<em>&nbsp;</em>“It’s part of the supersaturated bit of the workflow. Like I am going on a two-hour-long walk in the middle of the wilderness and then next thing, it is what is framing the way I am thinking. Like if I need to write, I always put on sad music. And so I may not be specifically thinking about what the audio track is, as I might be aware of the emotion it creates. So I guess it is with me pretty early on -- maybe way before I know what I am going to do.”<br></p><p>A lot of people describe Cohen’s work as psychedelic -- which he doesn’t agree with. It’s how a certain implication comes with that description, and what it then says about creativity in a way that discredits artistic skill that he doesn’t align with. But at the same time, he adds,&nbsp;“psychedelic implies very little constraint and it is very noisy and decadent. And like that, overwrought. In my mind, those are the parts of my art that I see, and I am constantly trying to work on and restrain.”<br></p><p>Cohen hopes that his work is noted for its handmade quality and all its humanity as it explores vulnerability. It’s hard to negotiate that space for artists - that tension between creating within restraints and creating with vulnerability. Cohen seeks out that tension as it sort of allows for his work to be more palpable.&nbsp;“One can only offer finesse and dignity -- but that at the same time is antithetical to the vulnerability of just like 'this is me'. And me is messy, like humans, in general, are messy. &nbsp;If you try to cut all the edges off of that messiness, you do not get to see the humanity of it. So I think I would love it if my work was described as luscious and hand made, and human. That would be the dream.”<br><br><br></p><p>Learn more about Isaac Cohen on his <a href="https://cabbi.bo/">website.</a></p><p>—</p><p><em>The MOR Artist Spotlight series features creators using VR as an artistic tool or medium of expression.

    date: "Jun 28, 2019",

    content: `<p>Over the last few years, we’ve been building the Museum of Other Realities (MOR), a virtual space for VR artists to exhibit their work and share the experience with others. We’re glad to announce that the MOR has entered Early Access, so you can get it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/613900/Museum_of_Other_Realities/">Steam</a>! You probably have a few questions, so read on to get some answers. Don’t hesitate to reach out to us on <a href="/community">Discord</a> or on our <a href="/contact-us">website</a>.</p><h3><strong>What is the MOR?</strong></h3><p>The MOR is a virtual art museum filled with mind-bending VR art. As an immersive multiplayer art showcase in VR, the MOR encourages visitors to view and interact with art in new ways , whether that means diving into a painting or touching the art, causing it to change shape. </p><p>VR, as a creative tool, is still pretty young and yet artists are already breaking new ground and creating amazing work with it. We realized that the same newness which gives artists the opportunity to experiment can also make it difficult for them to get their work seen by a wider audience as intended. So we set out to address this with the MOR.</p><h3><strong>Where is the Museum located? Can I visit in-person?</strong></h3><p>The MOR is a museum <em>in VR</em>, so there’s no physical location to visit. All you need is a VR headset and VR-ready PC and you can visit the museum from anywhere in the world at any time.</p><h3><strong>Why Early Access?</strong></h3><p>We have many things planned for the MOR, which means we could either keep building quietly until we have a <em>presumably-</em>perfect, shiny version of the Museum, or release a version now, gather valuable feedback from a wider audience, and iterate. This was actually a difficult decision, but we remembered how much the MOR has evolved over the years thanks to all the feedback we’ve received, and ultimately decided this was the way to go.</p><p>Plus, artists grow over time, as do the tools they use and their art styles. This Early Access release allows us to share their work with a wider audience while also showcasing their growth alongside ours.</p><h3><strong>What is included in the Early Access version?</strong></h3><p>The Early Access version is a smaller, streamlined edition of the Museum, usually for demoing at festivals and conferences. Even though it doesn’t have all the artwork and features we’d like to showcase (yet), the mechanics are in place for an immersive experience featuring amazing art. Over the next few months, we’ll build upon the experience, expanding not only the Museum’s architecture but also the variety of artwork we feature and the ways in which players can interact with them. </p><p>Here is a rough roadmap of the big features expected:</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;• In-headset UI</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;• Refined Avatars</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;• Improved social safety controls</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;• Public server browser</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;• New museum architecture</p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;• New exhibits every month</p><p>The museum is updated regularly, so in addition to features, there’s always going to be new art and events during and after the Early Access period. </p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1600px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1600px"><div><img alt="‘Prey’ by Nick Ladd, on display in the MOR" src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/prey-photo-v2.png"></div><figcaption>‘Prey’ by Nick Ladd, on display in the MOR</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><h3><strong>How is the MOR priced?</strong></h3><p>The MOR is a $19.99 USD one-time purchase on Steam.</p><p>In addition to providing a space for artists to share their work, one of our main goals has always been to support the artists we feature. To this end, exposure, on its own, isn’t sufficient crypto-currency. We charge for the MOR because promoting the artists is equally as important as paying them for their work. We intend to continue supporting artists and the team responsible for making this museum a ‘reality’. This is especially significant because the MOR is an <em>ongoing </em>experience with amazing new art being added on a regular basis.</p><h3><strong>How long will the MOR be in Early Access?</strong></h3><p>There's quite a bit of work to be done before we leave Early Access, so while we don’t have an exact date yet, we are currently aiming to release the feature-complete beta later this year. We’ll keep you in the loop.</p><h3><strong>How will you keep us up-to-date with what’s happening at the MOR</strong></h3><p>We post about updates and events on our <a href="/blog">blog</a> and social channels (<a href="https://twitter.com/MuseumOR">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/museumorealities/">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MuseumOR/">Facebook</a>). We also have a <a href="/community">Discord server</a> where you can provide feedback and discuss the experience with other players, featured artists, and the MOR dev team.</p><p><br></p><p>‍</p>`

    content: `<p>We’re excited to confirm that there’s no longer a paywall to get into the MOR!<br></p><h5>It’s been a journey<br></h5><p>If you’ve heard our inception story, the MOR was originally called the ‘TH-er’. That was in 2017. Accessibility may remain a challenge in some harder-to-solve-for ways, but this is a significant step. The MOR was conceived in seemingly simpler times - positioning the ambition to be a ‘virtual magazine’ for flipping (read: flying) through VR art.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1920px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1920px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/b27c99f7-7da7-48d1-8f58-3e4c7f48dfe7-2-copy.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>‍<br></p><h5>Building a virtual stage for virtual art&nbsp;<br></h5><p>We’ve always been grateful to the artists we came in touch with, who inspired the space that their work was to inhabit. And while our developers knew that the MOR could be seen as a precipice of VR art - we wanted it to be a flexible vessel with no growing pains. We wanted to ensure we earn the belief of those who first hear our calling. We chose to weave with the thread that holds the seams between art and technology taut. In doing so, we formed a community of curious, talented, and magnificent visionaries.&nbsp;<br></p><p>While the adoption of VR is unmistakable across industries, in most instances it thrives where there is intersectionality. When it comes to solving for discovery -- ‘travel cost’ can be calculated in creative ways. We believe that by persisting through the current phase and standing by the fact that XR experiences are best served through immersion, we are part of a movement validating the reaches of the medium. In the last year, despite a global pandemic, we’ve served as a safe venue for festival visitors (<em>Cannes XR, VIFF, VRHam, Fabric of Reality, Immersive Arcade and XR3</em>) from around the world to immerse in stellar works of art.<br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1920px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1920px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/0794ec68-89ff-4fa7-bc8f-85a53b271f25-e4ffcb0a-4b8b-4340-8ae6-8682a9d10a7b-copy.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>If you’ve been in the MOR, it’s a place that births new belief in astounding ways. At the heart of what we’ve nurtured is the inherently social nature of art. We might’ve had the chops to create a space where art can be collectively engaged with, but the people we’ve come by have helped us grow, muscle and limb. The artists we’ve championed, the visitors who’ve shared their love, the partners we’ve expanded with - you know who you are!&nbsp;<br></p><p>We owe our current flourish to everyone who engages in the bottomless conversation about what we could be immersed in next. We want to thank those of you who purchased the MOR app, as without you we wouldn’t be here. We’ll be in touch with in-app gifts of gratitude!&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p>`

    content: `<p>Perhaps this event can be branded for bringing VR lore in the MOR - as Skillman and Hackett from the VR studio by the same name, <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/tag/skillman-and-hackett/">Skillman &amp; Hackett</a> will be narrating the conception story of Tilt Brush in the MOR, <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=bnVuM2JrdTVndml0dml0cjd2c3Q1MW4xbTAgbXVzZXVtb3IuY29tX202dGZ0N2s5Y2w5c2JiYzgzMG5rbDgyMW1zQGc">this Thursday</a> on <strong>Feb 25th, 2021 at 6.30 PM PT</strong>.</p><p>Tilt Brush was developed as part of a number of different augmented reality, virtual reality, and natural motion experiences in 2014 at the company Skillman &amp; Hackett, before being acquired by Google in 2015. The creators have mentioned previously (in a 2016 article that featured on <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3056668/googles-tilt-brush-is-the-first-great-vr-app">Fast Company</a>) how the idea of drawing in 3D space came from a chess game prototype they were working on - <em>“It was a happy accident. Tilt Brush came out of an experiment with a virtual reality chess prototype, where we accidentally started painting the chess pieces in the air, and it was incredible”. </em><br></p><p>Now the latest news doing the rounds in VR circles about this award-winning application was announced on January 26 this year, when Google released the source code to the game under the Apache 2.0 license on GitHub. Celebrating a month since the announcement, we thought that bringing Skillman and Hackett in as guest speakers - the original creators of Tilt Brush themselves - would be fitting. </p><p>A truly stellar <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyBittman/status/1354206665155862529">twitter thread by Danny Bittman</a> from the same day that Google announced Tilt Brush VR being made open source, and shut down internal development does a nostalgic take on the journey of the application and its creative purposes as deemed by users.&nbsp;<br><em><br><br></em></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:660px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="660px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/xgeagzjxbsboj2plqozuw2bxxqwbmfr0uwk3qpvlecnhaa52hmz8emucw8utpb2xj1tfbhcq8fiaft5ot942tcexg8jyjtefetdvkqlhcui0n4istwxzahx96khkrq8abvpsxin1.gif" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>While in earlier versions of Tilt Brush, it was only possible to draw on two-dimensional planes, users of the application can attest to why Tilt Brush has won itself the accolades it has. With the promise that Tilt Brush turns your room into your canvas and your palette into your imagination, with endless possibilities- the application is now available on Vive, Oculus, Oculus Quest, Windows MR, Valve Index and PlayStation VR. For those unfamiliar with the application, here’s a tidbit from Nicholas Scibetta, who <a href="https://gamecrate.com/interview-tilt-brush-creator-patrick-hackett-developing-vives-killer-app/13331">interviewed</a> Skillman and Hackett in 2016;</p><blockquote>‍<br>“Tilt Brush allows users to paint in 3D space with one hand while the other hand works as your palette, tool box, and menu. You can paint with an enormous variety of exotic materials (including neon light, animated fire, or streams of rainbows) and then save, share, and remix your creations and those of others. Tilt Brush is what many say is what you should put on for someone trying VR for the first time, or someone who isn't a traditional gamer, to sell them on the VR experience.”</blockquote><p>We are keen on hearing the longer version of the Skillman &amp; Hackett story with a rich sneak peek promised from the prototyping period of Tilt Brush. The talk is titled<em> ‘Tilt Brush by Accident: Our Creative Process for Emerging Technologies’ </em>with some pointers on how-to-innovate within the VR industry.<br><br></p><h4>About Patrick Hackett:<br></h4><p>Patrick Hackett is an independent game developer and creative technologist. He is co-creator of "Tilt Brush" and is currently working on an unannounced game with I-Illusions, creators of Space Pirate Trainer. Prior to diving deep on AR &amp; VR, Patrick worked in the games industry for over a decade as a Gameplay Engineer and Project Lead. Patrick applies cross disciplinary skills including design, engineering, and physics to create immersive experiences at the bleeding-edge intersection of art and technology.</p><p>‍<br></p><h4>About Drew Skillman:<br></h4><p>Drew Skillman is a creative coder and technical artist.&nbsp; He is co-creator of "Tilt Brush", and is currently working on unannounced computer vision &amp; machine learning powered interactive experiences at Google.

Darkfield - the studio behind&nbsp;<em>The Invisible</em>&nbsp;started creating spatial audio experiences in shipping containers. The shows were experienced in complete darkness, with headphones on.&nbsp;<em>The Invisible</em>&nbsp;is their first-ever VR piece, and it was exciting for them to explore this new medium.&nbsp;</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="padding-bottom:56.206088992974244%" data-rt-type="video" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="" data-rt-max-height="56.206088992974244%" data-rt-dimensions="854:480" data-page-url="https://youtu.be/iI6UNJSRgGA"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iI6UNJSRgGA"></iframe></div></figure><p><br></p><p>When David Rosenberg and Glen Lee first started to collaborate as artistic directors, they created work for audiences in the dark, which would get placed into theaters that had to be blacked out. It was only later that they started to install the work in shipping containers. The idea was to put the audience in a sustainable environment where they feel a bit vulnerable, while finding distance from distractions that are hard to cut out in theatres. A key component of the work being in darkness is that it allows for the creation of doubt about what is real and what is imagined. As a viewer, the never-quite-knowing whether what they hear is happening in their headphones or the space around them is a little spin being leaned into.&nbsp;<br></p><p><em>“Immersion is very much about the imagination, and by removing the sense of sight for the entire audience asks them to create an image of the event in their mind, in the new environment that they're in. We started making this work not intending for the show to be frightening - that wasn't what we were initially exploring. But we found from our first shows that it was one of the main things in audience feedback. The immersive sound really creates the presence of characters next to you.”&nbsp;</em>- David Rosenberg.</p><p>‍</p><h3>NOTES ON BLINDNESS</h3><p>By Novelab<br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1600px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1600px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/1sewykovbifzu9um5foh9eg1v7cdoafcjhfkia641lgup18ymz1lcm8iwhkd1j8yxw2uin2tuo7ntpxvandpt7hs8b2xy7r4giub0suat4bpyc3gd71kyitjmezhyzt4dfikv92a.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p><em>Notes on Blindness</em>&nbsp;qualifies as one of the VR classics.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The idea for&nbsp;<em>Notes on Blindness</em>&nbsp;began as a podcast, with an interactive element. When the Novelab team began prototyping, they realized that they were lacking something because talking about blindness by using only sound for a sighted audience lacked this relationship between the senses. Using omnidirectional sound, the team wanted to translate into visuals an experience of space for sighted people - to truly experience what John Hill describes.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="padding-bottom:56.206088992974244%" data-rt-type="video" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="" data-rt-max-height="56.206088992974244%" data-rt-dimensions="854:480" data-page-url="https://youtu.be/GuFA4g1YXOw"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GuFA4g1YXOw"></iframe></div></figure><p><br></p><p>The experience is created using the distance between the elements in the architecture and movement from a rooted standpoint. The idea was to create a revelation of the environment using the contact between things in the surroundings of the listener. The scene has been rendered very partially by using a kind of bluish texture system, and an intention to “try to inverse”, as the usual perspective immersive viewers know is that the visuals drive the sound. Amaury shared how the team at Novelab had an insight about visual memories - that they just disappear even for sighted people. Visuals become meaningless real fast, and so why should the brain even store those things?&nbsp;<br></p><p><em>“We do not claim that we represent how a blind person perceives the world but we tried to create an idea for sighted people how it can feel to perceive things differently. So we came up with this whole representation.</em>&nbsp;- Amaury La Burthe</p><h3>‍<br>FLY</h3><p>By Charlotte Mikkelborg</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:3840px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="3840px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/e206550c-6d91-44cc-b6e3-737d41469163-4f5fc75e-c082-46f6-9192-f9a36b4989f2-1.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>By Director and Immersive Creator, Charlotte Mikkelborg,&nbsp;<em>Fly</em>&nbsp;was originally built and set to greet potential fliers in London, at Saatchi gallery - inside a “massive egg”.

Da Vinci made huge inroads figuring out flight, but never actually quite got there. In the second chapter of the experience, you get to pilot one of his flying contraptions. And then by the third chapter, you become Wilbur Wright on the wing of the Wright flyer and get to pilot that first flight for humankind.” -Charlotte Mikkelborg</em></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="padding-bottom:56.206088992974244%" data-rt-type="video" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="" data-rt-max-height="56.206088992974244%" data-rt-dimensions="854:480" data-page-url="https://youtu.be/5hjJQ380yuU"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5hjJQ380yuU"></iframe></div></figure><p><br></p><p>The experience takes you through 100 years of flight - you get to pilot the first international passenger plane, and then the Concorde and eventually, in the final part - take a plunge into the unknown, a potential future of flight 100 years from now. What was really important in the design of this experience was not only an exciting journey but one where you learn about humans made flight possible.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In her research of how the VR medium could be fully utilized, Mikkelborg saw a 1000 pictures on the Internet of Sandra Bullock and the rig designed for her during the filming of Gravity. And that had been designed by Neil Courbould's Oscar-winning practical effects team (Ready Player One, Gravity, Gladiator).</p><p><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="padding-bottom:56.206088992974244%" data-rt-type="video" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="" data-rt-max-height="56.206088992974244%" data-rt-dimensions="854:480" data-page-url="https://youtu.be/eg-Ax22hrWg"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eg-Ax22hrWg"></iframe></div></figure><p>‍</p><p>A custom-made motion platform was created for the full installation version of&nbsp;<em>Fly</em>&nbsp;which viewers could mount and then put a headset on. Once they entered the experience, there’d be key moments in the narrative where taking flight could be experienced through multi-sensory elements. Like feeling the sun on your face, the wind coming at you or smelling different environments being flown over.&nbsp;<em>Fly</em>&nbsp;being in the MOR has allowed viewers to experience it beyond the physical installation version.</p><p>‍</p><h3>COMMON GROUND</h3><p>By East City Films<em>‍</em><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1629px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1629px"><div><img src="/mor-new/images/blog/content/2d145bd3-9653-4e07-897d-56627ad53855-119c9909-e9d1-4487-9d4b-6635d5b51641-1.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>C<em>ommon Ground</em>&nbsp;is a VR documentary by Darren Emerson, about the regeneration of the Aylesbury Estate in South London. There’s cultural specificity about a piece like this, but it resonates with people all over the world. East City Films have done well in capturing the experience of people who have a stake in the redevelopment project.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Darren Emerson recently wrote reports as a VSI, with his colleagues and Tucker, looking specifically at how we could talk about Common Ground around the country to other councillors states and independent cinemas. Being part of this is just another step to getting more people to VR. Common Ground is a documentary about a place, its people, the homes that were built on that property, and the people who grew up there and are affected by it being torn down. The piece makes efforts to preserve these stories - the viewer can be in someone's flat, or on their floor in a composite version of the estate. There’s a spatial sense of the estate as you can hear what it sounds like in there. So even as the physical estate is disappearing slowly, its image has been preserved in the piece and what the Aylesbury Estate represents in UK history.</p><p>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="padding-bottom:56.206088992974244%" data-rt-type="video" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="" data-rt-max-height="56.206088992974244%" data-rt-dimensions="854:480" data-page-url="https://youtu.be/ywp4ldUbsM0"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ywp4ldUbsM0"></iframe></div></figure><p><br></p><p>Darren Emerson shared how, as Aylesbury Estate is the largest such institution in London, the regeneration period has spanned over about 20 years. This has meant tearing it down bit by bit, and slowly displacing the people that live there, making it hard for them to find another affordable option. The documentary explores this regeneration, while also exploring the history of social housing in the UK.&nbsp;<br></p><p><em>“It looks sort of, like the disenfranchisement of the working classes in the UK. And really at its heart is an experience about community experience, about homes. And that's obviously quite universal. A universal thing doesn't relate specifically to London, it can, it can be anywhere.” - Darren Emerson</em></p><p>‍</p>`
